We also reviewed a news release about this research. Among the story\u2019s strengths: It alerts readers that the study \u2014 presented as an abstract \u2014 has yet to be peer-reviewed and published, and it provides cautious comments from an independent source, although they appear at the very end. However, the story leaves readers in the dark about how the treatment was evaluated and what it costs, and misses some important limitations with the evidence. It largely ignored potential harms, including the possibility that some patients might be treated unnecessarily because the cause of back pain can be difficult to diagnose. Back pain is a common problem. Often it goes away with time and exercise. But chronic pain that does not respond to conservative treatment and includes shooting pain into the buttocks and leg (sciatica) is a leading cause of disability and an economic burden. More treatment options are needed, but identifying the true source of pain is part of the battle.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"11585","claim":"New Findings Show Xience Stents Are as Safe and Effective as Others","explanation":"This story is an example of what\u2019s often missing in medical research stories in a business section. The story is about a new cardiovascular stent that may be available if it receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration. But the story does not provide much insight about the actual utility of implanting stents. The story quoted an investigator on the project as saying that there was a lower heart-attack rate in those patients receiving this new stent. However \u2013 the published study indicated that while there were fewer heart attacks, this difference was not statistically significant. Beyond this, it is a comparison of heart attack rates in individuals who received stents and does include any indication of how this rate compares to that seen in people receiving optimal medical therapy but who don\u2019t get a stent. The story fails to deliver any independent perspective \u2013 only letting us hear from a company spokesman and one study investigator. Not everyone who reads medical research stories in a business section is interested primarily as a shareholder. Some people want more context, more on the quality of the evidence, more on the size of the potential benefits and harms, and more on what this thing is likely to cost them. This story \u2013 which reported more on the competition among or revenues for device manufacturers \u2013 didn\u2019t help those readers.

There is wide agreement that losses in one year can be carried forward and that salaries are an unavoidable expense, to mention just two factors. Special tax breaks and abuses of the tax code exist but even an analysis from a group that shares many of Sanders\u2019 perspectives pointed to a ratio that was, at most, one out of six and possibly as small as one out of 16.

{"claim_id":"10257","claim":"Busting the vitamin C myth","explanation":"This report does a good job of using a recent, credible report to debunk the myth that taking vitamin C can prevent or treat colds.

This is\u00a0a\u00a0major error that can mislead viewers about a very serious condition. (This problem is compounded at the end of the piece when the host says, \"I\u2019m still taking vitamin C,\" without any challenge from the physician-journalist.)

{"claim_id":"10075","claim":"Children in intensive care recover faster with little to no nutrition","explanation":"This brief news release, issued by a university\u00a0hospital system in Belgium, is loosely based on published results of\u00a0a multinational, randomized clinical study designed to test the value of adding early intravenous macronutrient feedings to the nutritional care of critically ill children in intensive care units who are unable to eat or be fed normally. Such\u00a0so-called \u201ctotal\u201d parenteral nutrition, delivered via the bloodstream, is commonplace\u00a0in pediatric ICUs, researchers say, because of concerns that\u00a0\u201cmacronutrient deficits\u201d will lead to increased infections, weakness, and longer stays on ventilators and in ICUs overall. The problem, however, has been the dearth of rigorous scientific evidence for this assumption in children, and \u2014 significantly \u2014 growing evidence in studies of adults that the practice actually delays healing and increases infections. The study on which the release is based does indeed add strong clinical evidence that the same is true for children, and that delaying for a week or so the use of full parenteral feedings is clearly associated with lower rates of infections and earlier discharge from the ICUs. But this release could leave some\u00a0readers with the misconception that starving critically ill children will hasten their recovery from a critical illness. Here\u2019s why: contrary to the language in the release, the study did not \u201cprove\u201d the idea that \u201creceiving little or no nutrition\u201d in the first week of an ICU stay \u201cmakes children recover faster.\u201d Nor were these children \u201cfasting,\u201d in the conventional sense. In fact, all of the children received micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), blood sugar controls, and \u201centeral\u201d nutrition in which some nutrients are delivered through a tube from the nose to the stomach. The release further misleadingly implies\u00a0that \u201cnutritional deficiency\u201d somehow directly leads to faster and better recoveries for seriously ill children; in fact, the authors of the published study report that the reason for the benefit of delaying total parenteral nutrition remains \u201cspeculative,\u201d but possibly due to complex effects of digestion and metabolism that have an impact on the immune system. Although numbers are hard to come by (and the release makes no effort to find any) an estimated quarter million infants and children a year are admitted to intensive care units with critical illnesses and injuries. Scientists know that\u00a0\u00a0the nutritional needs of children\u2019s rapidly growing brains and bodies\u00a0make their care trickier in some respects than adult care, and the use of intravenous feedings of a complete package of calories and specific nutrients are\u00a0commonly started within 24 hours of an ICU stay. But few studies have been done to test the value of such feedings, usually given as supplements or sometimes in place of enteral feedings of some nutrients through a nasogastric tube. And studies in adults have strongly suggested that parenteral feedings are associated with higher rates of infection and longer ICU stays. This study matters because treatment of children in the ICU is not uncommon and the outcomes of interest (time in the ICU, complication rates, death) are important to everyone.","label":"false"}

It explains\u00a0that the\u00a0trial was conducted in Britain, where people generally have lower selenium intakes than in the U.S. \u2014 so the results may not\u00a0apply here. And it was careful not to suggest that selenium might be an alternate\u00a0to statin drugs or other\u00a0remedies for high cholesterol. The story did not provide as many\u00a0details as the competing Reuters report on this study, however. The effects of selenium on cholesterol levels were not\u00a0quantified, and\u00a0there was\u00a0no information on costs. Selenium is a component of multivitamins taken by millions of Americans on a daily basis. Selenium supplements are also taken\u00a0individually in the hope that they will ward off\u00a0chronic diseases such as\u00a0cancer and heart disease. While there isn\u2019t much evidence that supplementation reduces the risk of these diseases in healthy individuals (and might increase the risk of diabetes), the results of this new research at least provide some reassurance\u00a0that selenium won\u2019t raise your cholesterol, which might\u00a0increase your cardiovascular risk.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"9215","claim":"Researchers develop automated melanoma detector for skin cancer screening","explanation":"This news release reports on a study of a computerized technology that combines imaging with digital analysis to help improve the screening of melanoma skin lesions. The news release explains the specificity and sensitivity of the test. It also clearly discloses who funded the research. One downside is that it\u2019s not until the final paragraph that we learn this is still experimental research that must be confirmed in larger studies. Earlier statements make it sound farther along, e.g., \u201cresearchers at The Rockefeller University have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages.\u201d A larger concern is how the release downplayed the high-false positive rate of 64%, saying this \u201capproaches\u201d the false-positive rate of manual detection by expert dermatologist, which studies put at about 32%. Melanoma can be very difficult to diagnose so if doctors could use a tool that helped better screen suspicious-looking moles, they might be able to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and save lives. This new approach thus far has shown promise, but further research will be needed to validate it as an enhanced diagnostic tool\u2013and that should be made upfront and clear to the journalists and consumers who read the news release.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":"10213","claim":"New DNA Tests Aimed at Reducing Colon Cancer","explanation":"Strengths:\u00a0 Immediately, in the opening words, the story acknowledges that there is another DNA test in development that was reported on this week. It was the only one of the four stories we reviewed on this topic that made this clear. Weaknesses: It didn\u2019t provide a meaningful comparison of the new approaches with existing colon cancer screening tests. It also has problems with how the underlying question is presented. Two examples:  \u201cThe new tests could help most people avoid colonoscopies, which are routinely prescribed for people over age 50.\u201d \u2013 perhaps implying to the reader that evidence supports a recommendation of colonoscopy for everyone.That is not the case; there are several potential screening tests available, including other stool tests \u2013 something not mentioned in the story. \u201cCompliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don\u2019t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy, and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine.\u201d This sentence has a lot of information, but is also somewhat misleading. Use of colonoscopy is actually pretty good, and most people who don\u2019t have one have never been asked, calling into question that people \u201cdon\u2019t want to have one.\u201d The cost effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. other screening techniques is a complex question, but suffice it to say that the new technology being studied is not likely to be more cost-effective overall (previous stool DNA tests have performed much worse (higher costs, lower efficacy) than colonoscopy in modeling studies. This topic is really about when we should pay attention to evidence about a new diagnostic test and how we should evaluate diagnostic tests in comparison with one another- a topic that is often inadequately discussed in both medicine and journalism.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"10562","claim":"The trouble with mammograms","explanation":"The idea that screening may be harmful is not often discussed in news stories. The story nicely presents this seemingly counter-intuitive point that finding more cancer may not save lives; however, the story could have discussed the role patients can play in deciding whether or not to get screened and how they could discuss this decision with physicians, who may be strong advocates for screening. The story does not mention that women could discuss an individualized screening schedule with their physician. Some women at higher-risk of breast cancer may be better candidates for annual screening between age 40-50 (or earlier, depending on family history or genetic markers), while others may not wish to screen until they are in their 50s or 60s. The story does not mention how physicians could counsel anxious patients on the true value of screening for breast cancer. The story does note that mass screening results in overtreatment and possibly unnecessary treatment for some women; however, the cost implications for such treatments are not discussed, an important omission at this time in the development of U.S. healthcare policy and physician reimbursements for screening. The story superbly cites expert epidemiologists and clinicians who discuss the problems with overselling mammograms and how this flies in the face of public health campaigns and U.S. clinical guidelines that women over 40 get annual mammograms. The story also cites a breast cancer survivor and advocate who questions the value of screening for some women. An advocate from a pro-screening group is also cited and her message is balanced by a clinician (who consults with the organization) who gives a tempered response to the latest data that screening may not benefit, and may even harm, women who are not at high-risk of developing aggressive breast cancer.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"11603","claim":"FDA approves Epclusa for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C virus infection","explanation":"This release announces the approval by the FDA of a new pill, Epclusa, for patients with chronic infections with Hepatitis C virus, also known as HCV. The tablet combines an existing drug, sofosbuvir, with a new drug, velpatasvir, and is the first single therapy for all six major forms of the virus. Patients can be infected with different forms and require different treatments. The release informs on the novelty, harms and benefits of the drug but doesn\u2019t give reporters \u2014 or lay readers \u2014 much background on the clinical trials that led to the approval. An estimated 120 million people have HCV infections worldwide, with an upper estimate of 3.9 million in the US alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This new treatment \u2014 Epclusa \u2014 has an estimated cost of about $74,800 per 12-week necessary therapy length \u2014 or about $900 per pill. But without treatment, many HCV patients may require years of treatment and suffer damage to their livers that require transplants and could ultimately be more expensive. The economics of new drugs is a vital part of any story about the drugs.

{"claim_id":"11471","claim":"To Inspect the Heart, Some Doctors Now Start at the Wrist","explanation":"This is an engaging and important enterprise story that explained a number of important issues to be factored in when considering medical interventions. It also nicely highlights the tension that exists in the development of new and presumably less invasive approaches to cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. It\u2019s refreshing to still find 1,600-word stories that go into such detail. It is clear from the story that:  Cardiologists are not of one mind about the value or benefit of doing cardiac catheterizations thorugh the radial artery in the wrist as opposed to the femoral artery in the groin. Different physicians value patient comfort differently. Different physicians may be more comfortable with, and better with, certain procedures. However what was lacking from this story was an examination of the overall success rate of the intended procedure. While patient comfort surely has value, procedure outcome is vital. We never learned any data about whether the actual goal of opening an artery is any better one way or another. Interestingly, the cited meta analysis is only partially acknowledged. While a trend was noted toward an advantage to the radial artery approach (in terms of bleeding and procedural outcome), the authors concluded a large randomized trial is necessary to determine the true value of the approach. And that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the story. Overall, though, the story delivers a clear picture of why patients need to have conversations with their caregivers about the risks and benefits of the various options available for their treatment. Being aware that there is often not a single answer to questions about the course of action is an important step towards making decisions that will get you the care that is best for you.

{"claim_id":"10019","claim":"MRI Might Screen for Autism","explanation":"The story presents almost no information from the research study. We just know it was about MRIs in males with autism and that the researchers found something abnormal. We don\u2019t know what the abnormal findings were, except they were related to how the hemispheres communicate. We don\u2019t know whether the findings fit with a theory about the biology of autism or whether this\u00a0was simply a fishing expedition. We don\u2019t know\u00a0how many of the 80 patients had the abnormality, if the MRI required special equipment or software, and if these were findings that any radiologist could detect. That\u2019s simply too many gaps to make the story reliable. Study authors\u2019 comments came from a news release. To its credit, the story did include cautious comments from one observer at the end. The challenge for this story is they are reporting on a basic science study, just one that happens to use MRI rather than bench techniques and one that was published in a specialized, technical journal. Autism is one of the most polarizing subjects in health, and the press can bear a big part of the blame. Reporting on autism tends to rely heavily on celebrity spokespeople, anecdotal profiles and advocacy organizations. It also has relied too much on science that has been improved upon or even discredited. That\u2019s why it is even more important for reporters covering new research in autism to bring a very critical eye to the topic and to make good use of independent experts who can separate the emotions that understandably run high around the disorder from the science behind the research.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":"9293","claim":"Five-Year Follow-Up Study Further Supports Effectiveness and Safety of the Essure\u00ae Procedure as a Non-Surgical, Non-Hormonal Option for Permanent Contraception","explanation":"In this news release Bayer HealthCare summarizes a long overdue post-market report on the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of Essure, an implant and procedure designed to bring about permanent contraception in women. It is the first permanent sterilization alternative to tubal ligation. The Essure implant is a small metal and polyester-like coil that when placed in the fallopian tubes causes an inflammatory response. The resulting scar tissue that develops over a three-month period prevents sperm from entering the fallopian tubes. Given mounting concerns about the safety of this device, it is crucial for any news release addressing safety to present a complete and balanced portrait of clinical research findings. But this news release is unacceptably one-sided. It never mentions that nearly a third of the women originally enrolled in this study dropped out for various reasons that could reflect a bad experience with the device (e.g. adverse events or pregnancy). It also understates the levels of pelvic pain reported by women who did complete the five-year study, and it never discloses that the study\u2019s lead author (and source quoted in the news release) is a paid consultant to Bayer. When Essure was approved in 2002, the FDA required the original manufacturer to monitor the outcomes of women who were enrolled in a clinical trial, upon which the agency\u2019s approval was based, for an additional four years. While this news release summary of the report portrays a successful product and process with few serious side effects, several news stories published days before the news release paint a very different picture. According to articles in the New York Times and other media, thousands of women are now asking the FDA to remove Essure from the market and inform the public about risks associated with the implant. Several others have filed legal action against Bayer, which acquired the implant from Conceptus in 2013. The Times article stated that the FDA has received more than 4,000 adverse event reports on Essure and that the original manufacturer received 16,047 complaints from women who had undergone Essure implants. In addition, ABC News in San Francisco reported that dozens of women staged a protest outside an obstetricians meeting while calling for the implant to be removed from the market. Another ABC affiliate in Arizona reported that the FDA will respond to a \u201cCitizen\u2019s Petition\u201d signed by more than 2,100 women asking that Essure be taken off the market. It\u2019s important that the safety of the device be given a fair public hearing so women considering sterilization can make informed judgments about the implants vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis tubal ligation. It should be noted that Conceptus, the original manufacturer, failed to report the outcome of the five-year study and that the results were submitted for publication a year after Bayer acquired the device. It\u2019s a disappointment that this summary report was delayed nine long years after the study was completed and 13 years after the FDA approved the device.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"9928","claim":"Palliative Care Consults for Patients with Advanced Cancers Reduces Hospitalization and Improves Quality of Care","explanation":"This news release reports results of a study that found that patients with advanced cancers who were referred early to palliative care made better use of support services, including palliative chemotherapy, after being discharged and had fewer hospital re-admissions and invasive treatments. Researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital obtained their data through a prospective cohort study (one that follows a group of patients over time to observe specific outcomes). Unfortunately, the absolute numbers \u2014 readily available in the study \u2014 showing the results were not included in the news release. But the release does provide good context in other areas, particularly in explaining what palliative care is and what it entails for patients. In an era when ethical and economic issues surrounding\u00a0end-of-life care\u00a0loom increasingly large, this study\u00a0addresses a critical issue. As the release points out, palliative care has positive implications for\u00a0emotional and other quality of life issues for patients. In contrast, extensive\u00a0time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, drives up costs\u00a0and is frequently in conflict with patients\u2019 explicitly expressed wishes. That being the case, it is\u00a0all the more important that a news release about this issue provide the information readers need to judge the quality\u00a0of the research method and put the results in context. As the authors of the journal article state: \u201cOur findings are particularly important because multiple studies suggest that patients with advanced cancer often do not understand their actual prognosis or goals of chemotherapy; when they do not, these patients are more likely to receive nonbeneficial interventions, which contribute to increased suffering.\u201d Many\u00a0patients with advanced cancer are classic cases of those who receive too much care, which is of no benefit. Not only that, it adds to their pain, anxiety, and degrades their and their families quality of life.

His figure strikes us as worthy of skepticism partly because research on this topic seems to be driven by up-front assumptions--some of them fiercely debated. As troubling, the figure reflects 2009 estimates reached using a previous estimate of how much of such costs were passed through in 2005, nearly a decade ago. We found no post-2009 state-by-state estimates of the cost impact, while other analyses have found that although cost-shifting occurs, private insurance rates are not greatly affected.

{"claim_id":"8999","claim":"Mice regrow brain tissue after stroke with bioengineered gel","explanation":"The news release summarizes a study on whether a gel \u2014 introduced into stroke-damaged areas of mouse brains \u2014 can stimulate the regrowth of neurons and blood vessels. The findings suggest that it can. But that\u2019s a far cry from proving that this regrowth can function as normal brain tissue and, therefore, be \u201cstroke-healing\u201d in humans. Still, the news release is one of the better releases we\u2019ve seen in terms of\u00a0 making it clear that the study was in mice. Mice is referenced in the headline and throughout. Compared to many news releases we review that have to do with rodent research, this one was also more cautious with its language than most. A more substantial discussion of the harms and benefits of this experimental treatment would have made the release even stronger. This study is part of a growing body of research called \u201cstroke neural repair,\u201d referring to the\u00a0 replacement of brain tissue damaged by a lack of blood flow, with new brain tissue. Although stroke is declining as a cause of death in the US, the fact that mortality from stroke is declining faster than the incidence, means we\u2019re likely to see an increase in the number of people who become chronically disabled from the disease. That\u2019s why there\u2019s such intense interest in repairing brain tissue damaged from stroke. As further headway is made in this important area of research, some key questions for journalists and readers will be: is the new growth really functioning brain tissue? If so, how do we know it\u2019s truly functional? And ultimately, the most difficult question of all, can it work in an integrated way with the rest of the brain?","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":"9210","claim":"Zinc eaten at levels found in biofortified crops reduces 'wear and tear' on DNA","explanation":"This news release describes a new study looking at the correlation between zinc intake and DNA damage and consequently makes a case for biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat. Although the release does an exemplary job explaining the role zinc plays in our bodies, it doesn\u2019t quite explain how this brief, small trial of 18 healthy men demonstrates the impact of zinc on cellular health. It uses vague, broad language to describe the study\u2019s findings and dedicates only one sentence to detail the study design. Part news release, part policy article and part biofortification promotion, the release argues for the need for food-based interventions, like crop biofortification, to address malnutrition and mineral deficiency around the world based on a small study of 18 healthy American men. That may be due to the fact that the research was funded by HarvestPlus, a research program advocating for biofortification to breed higher levels of micronutrients directly into staple food crops. We wish this funding source was disclosed in the news release, as well as the question of how prevalent the practice of biofortification already is around the world. Most US news releases relate studies like this one to dietary supplements, but this news release addresses hidden hunger and malnutrition. Zinc deficiency is a public health issue in many developing countries, especially those with rice-based diets. Access to seafood, red meat and poultry (foods rich in zinc) is also a challenge for many vulnerable populations. If crop biofortification is proven to be a safe, reliable and cost-effective way to deliver essential vitamins and minerals to nutrient-deficient populations, then it should be seen as a much needed food-based intervention to improve global health.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"10994","claim":"Breast cancer diagnosis gets a boost with gammagrams","explanation":"This story describes a new breast imaging modality that relies on injecting a radioactive label into the bloodstream and using a gamma radiation detector to see if tissue in the breast lights up, presumably identifying cancer cells. It is described as less painful than mammograms and perhaps cheaper than MRI. The story mentions the lack of evidence for its use as a test but at the same time provides perhaps overly enthusiastic patient anecdotes. The story makes good use of possibly disinterested experts, but their cautious statements may be overmatched by happy consumers and radiologists who have invested in the technology. The important caveat, appearing but perhaps overwhelmed in the story, is that it is not yet known whether the test works as well as current technologies (mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI), nor whether it can improve health outcomes. Whether or not it is cheaper than another test is less relevant than whether the information generated has clinical value. If this story had provided some hard data about how well or poorly this new test performs in relation to standard practice, we would have thought more highly of it. But kudos for putting this caveat so high in the story (4th sentence):\u00a0 \"not enough studies have been done to show it saves lives and money\" and for trying to inject some caveats throughout.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"9289","claim":"Definitive tests for irritable bowel syndrome developed at Cedars-Sinai: New blood tests will speed up diagnosis for the most common GI disorder","explanation":"Image from ibschek.com The release states that two \u201csimple\u201d new blood tests can be used to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by detecting antibodies that signal the presence of toxins that can cause IBS. This diagnosis, in turn, would allow patients to receive treatment more quickly. But the release has many problems that start with the headline, which claims there is now a \u201cdefinitive\u201d test for IBS. That\u2019s an exaggeration, as the findings need further validation and they apply only to a subset of patients with diarrhea as their main symptom \u2014 something the release never explains. The release also glosses over some significant points \u2014 such as the fact that there were only 43 control patients (too small a group to draw \u201cdefinitive\u201d conclusions), and that there\u2019s no evidence that treating patients based on these test results will actually improve their outcomes. The cost of the test and its potential harms \u2014 e.g. false-positive results that lead to unnecessary or misguided treatment \u2014 also aren\u2019t explored in any way. [Editor\u2019s note: We\u2019ve also published a review of a CBS News story about the test that shares many of the same shortcomings as this release.] While it\u2019s not clear how many people suffer from IBS, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDKD) reports that IBS affects at least 3 percent of the adult population \u2014 and probably closer to 10 or 15 percent of the adult population. The term \u201cIBS\u201d\u00a0refers to a range of bowel symptoms including pain, constipation, and\/or diarrhea. IBS is not meant to represent a single underlying cause, but in fact may represent a number of different conditions that result in functional bowel symptoms. This news release refers to an attempt to develop a test to better categorize certain patients with IBS. Though the news release implies the test is for all patients with IBS, in fact it evaluated two tests for individuals with IBS who had diarrhea as the predominant symptom. The implication that these tests\u00a0may provide a diagnosis for IBS more\u00a0broadly is not correct. Whether these tests hold up as being accurate when applied more broadly to patients with IBS and other related bowel conditions remains to be proven. It would also be important to see how common the test is positive in individuals without chronic bowel symptoms. Finally, even if these tests are specific for individuals with diarrhea-predominant IBS, it\u2019s unclear if it would make any difference in their treatment or lead to a reduction in the severity of symptoms. That\u2019s a premise that still needs to be tested.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"10458","claim":"Testing Athletes\u2019 Hearts May Cut Deaths","explanation":"The article describes a study from Italy that reports that rates of sudden cardiac death fell after a screening program with EKG prior to sports participation was instituted. The article does a nice job of including cost and harms information. Letting readers know that screening can lead to unnecessary procedures (which have risks) is particularly valuable, given that many people perceive screening programs to be harmless. The story also provides statements to caution readers about the strength of the evidence, although the fact that this was a population-based cohort study which could not account for all confounders could have been clearer. The article reports benefits in relative terms; providing absolute reductions would have been best particularly because the relative reduction of 89% looks quite large, but the absolute risk is small in the first place and the risk reduction is even smaller. The article also does not describe any alternatives to screening with EKG. Often athletes do have a history and physical before participation and an accompanying editorial published with the study points out that this type of screening may be just as effective as screening with EKG, but we just don\u2019t know. Overall, a balanced presentation, in only 600 words.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":"11337","claim":"Is it Brain Infection or Cancer? A New Rapid Test Could Hold the Answer","explanation":"This news release promotes a study in the journal PLoS ONE by researchers at Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. The crux: Even basic problems with the brain and other parts of the central nervous system, or CNS, are not only serious but also tough to diagnose \u2014 and especially so in rapid fashion. According to the release, a test that uses a little cerebrospinal fluid, or CNF, gathered from a patient\u2019s spine might help doctors quickly narrow down whether they are dealing with an infection (by a virus, bacteria, or fungus) or some other issue, such as a demyelinating disease or cancer. The key to making this possible are cytokines \u2014 tiny proteins that cells release to sound the alarm to one another \u2014 and a device that can quickly test a small sample of CNF for dozens of different cytokines and their abundances. The release\u2019s title does a decent job of not selling the moon, since it does not promise the \u201choly grail\u201d of identifying a specific problem with one test \u2014 just the presence of an infection or something else. However, the teasing of a rapid doctor\u2019s office-style test when one does not yet exist, and when the sample size is so small (43 people with a wide variety of issues participated) seems dubious \u2014 especially when one of its own authors says additional research is needed to confirm the core findings. It\u2019s also important to highlight that this early data is a \u201cretrospective analysis,\u201d which means that even if the sample size of patients were bigger, it would only suggest that further prospective work needed to be done to validate the testing in patients. Problems with brains and spinal cords are often tough to diagnose. This is because infections by bacteria, fungi, and viruses can manifest similarly to other issues, like cancer or autoimmune diseases. The blood-brain barrier makes sampling the fluid that can hint at what\u2019s going on tricky and painful \u2014 so making the most use of a sample is best. It\u2019s especially key with the youngest patients, whose still-developing bodies and immature immune systems may not be prepared to handle major problems like encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)and also can\u2019t describe their symptoms. If a one-stop test existed that could help doctors rapidly narrow down a long list of suspects for a CNS problem, it could save valuable time and financial resources, and potentially patients\u2019 lives. If this test can be validated it could conceivably improve speed of diagnosis in order to get the most appropriate treatment.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9009","claim":"Brain scans may help diagnose neurological, psychiatric disorders","explanation":"This news release reports findings from a study of functional MRI (fcMRI) scans in which researchers\u00a0analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people. During the scans, each person performed a variety of tasks to determine the extent to which their behaviors altered the picture of their brain activity. The researchers found that each person\u2019s brain imaging changed little from day-to-day or task-to-task. That is, the brain scans appeared to reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain. The release suggests that, based on these findings, its possible to use this type of brain scan to diagnose individual traits or diseases. That is very premature. Diagnostic tests have yet to be developed. The release headline promises more than the news release delivers, and there\u2019s a real question as to whether this information is useful to the public, or just misleading. The heading of this news release proclaims hopefully that \u201cBrain scans may help diagnose neurological, psychiatric disorders.\u201d\u00a0 Whereas at present depression, bipolar disorder, and many other mental illnesses can only be diagnosed based on self-reported symptoms or observations of behavior, this release suggests we are on the verge of being able to diagnose these conditions via a particular type of MRI. However, the study referred to simply laid the groundwork for research testing whether functional networks in individuals\u2019 brains are relatively stable over time. Diagnostic applications remain to be developed.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":"9848","claim":"Prostate cancer treatment may spark heart problems","explanation":"Although this story tries to put things in perspective, the headline and lead sentences push readers onto shaky ground that is not supported by the evidence presented. It jumps back and forth between evidence and speculation. This story improperly presents hormone therapy as a single type of treatment and the choice for patients being to either get \u201cit\u201d or not. In fact, there are several varieties of hormonal approaches used in prostate cancer treatment and this study found that different therapies were associated with different levels of heart disease risk, thus raising the possibility that refining treatment choices could minimize the concerns. The study was an observational review of heart disease among men being given hormonal therapies for prostate cancer. The story should have made clear that this type of study cannot establish cause-and-effect. What\u2019s more, the study design appears to have serious limitations that are not addressed in the story. This last point highlights one hazard of reporting on presentations at medical meetings; unlike articles published in leading journals, meeting presentations do not undergo formal peer review. As a result, weaknesses in the design, gaps in the data and alternative explanations may be undeclared\u2026 and then unreported by journalists.","label":"MISLEADING"}

We would have liked to have seen more of the evidence presented in absolute terms, though, to help readers understand the significance of the findings. As with many of the findings coming out of the landmark Women\u2019s Health Initiative study, research related to calcium and heart health can leave consumers confused and even scared. Does calcium in a regular, balanced diet raise a person\u2019s risk of having a heart attack or stroke or does this only apply to calcium supplements? And might the effect of those supplements be mitigated by other components of a person\u2019s diet? All of these are questions that arise out of the series of studies that have begun to pile up in recent years. This story goes a long way toward answering some of them, but it also may leave readers confused on several points.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"8967","claim":"Scans cut heart attack rates and save lives, major study finds","explanation":"This brief news release describes a single positive finding from the 4,000-patient SCOT-HEART study:\u00a0 roughly half of patients with stable chest pain who were randomized to receive computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and standard care had fewer heart attacks over 5 years than those who received standard care alone. But there\u2019s a flaw in the headline and first sentence of the release. This study shows zero difference in deaths, and as the authors acknowledge in the published study, the entire difference between the groups was driven by non-fatal heart attacks. Another problem with the news release is that these benefits are expressed in dramatic relative terms, instead of the much more modest (and helpful) absolute terms. Readers are left with little guidance regarding what may account for the slight drop, and if this really represents a \u201cmajor\u201d reduction as claimed by the lead author. Finally, readers would have been better served if a discussion of alternative screening methods, conflicts of interest, and potential downstream costs and risks had been included. As a positive, the release mentions the potential to avoid\u00a0invasive testing via angiogram, which has a very real death rate. What may really be at issue here is whether roughly $1 million scanners are truly better than the non-invasive tests we already have. It remains unclear which patients benefit most from these tests, whether the scans provide actionable information (or simply lead to further confirmatory tests), and what will be their true costs.","label":"false"}

The number of C-sections is rising, mostly because many women who had a C-section for their last baby are choosing to have another C-section rather than trying to give birth vaginally. Because this type of C-section is scheduled, there may be some pressure to schedule it earlier than recommended for the convenience of the mother, family, or physician. This study examines the risks of scheduling the procedure at 37 weeks\u2013when babies generally reach gestational maturity\u2013or later, but before the recommended 39 weeks.

{"claim_id":"10611","claim":"Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise","explanation":"This story on an experimental desensitization treatment for peanut allergies oversells the promise of the research and the importance of the studies.

{"claim_id":"9410","claim":"Early Prostate Cancer Kept at Bay in Two Studies for High-Risk Men","explanation":"This story summarizes the results of two studies involving drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. The main takeaway from the story is that in certain men with high-risk cancers who\u2019ve already had their prostates removed, the drugs extended the amount of time before these men\u2019s cancer spread beyond the prostate. The story helpfully quantifies the amount of time the drugs bought these men in absolute terms. But the story missed some important context. For example, the story is totally silent on the issue of adverse effects and how many patients suffered them. And it doesn\u2019t caution that the outcome reported in the study \u2014 \u201cmetastasis-free survival\u201d \u2014 may not translate to a corresponding increase in patients\u2019 overall length of life. Disease-mongering was also a concern. The story features statistics about the huge numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed each year, but it doesn\u2019t acknowledge that most of these cancers will never progress to cause problems for the patient. Moreover, it erroneously suggests that prostate removal is the \u201ctypical\u201d approach to the treatment of early prostate cancer, when no treatment at all is the approach favored by about half of all men who receive such a diagnosis. An independent source would probably have helped bring some balance to the coverage, but the only experts quoted had a vested interest in the research. Despite having their prostates removed, men with aggressive forms of prostate cancer face a higher risk of having that cancer spread beyond the prostate. There is currently little that such men can do following initial treatment except watch and wait, but these preliminary results suggest that certain drugs may delay the spread of these cancers. Until the results are published and scrutinized by other researchers, however, it\u2019s best to reserve judgment and view the claims of vested interests skeptically.","label":"MISLEADING"}

While this story accurately reports key drug trial results and provides some context, it falls short in important ways by failing to note that there is not yet evidence the drug is safe for life-long use or can extend lives; and that it is unlikely to cure CF by itself. The story doesn\u2019t tell readers that drug is likely to come with an extremely high price tag. It fails to note that the CF Foundation, whose CEO is prominently quoted touting the drug, has funded the drug\u2019s development and may stand to profit from its sales. Cystic fibrosis affects only about 70,000 people worldwide, but it is the most common lethal genetic disease in whites, slowly destroying their lungs and other organs. Since the primary CF mutation was identified in 1989, researchers have sought a treatment that would correct the underlying defect. As the story reports, this trial is an important proof of concept; it is a \u2018big deal\u2019 in the decades-long effort to find a treatment for the genetic defect underlying CF. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight the long, hard road traveled to reach this point and the years of work ahead that will be needed to determine if this sort of treatment can lengthen the lives of typical CF patients.","label":"false"}

The problem is that the story doesn\u2019t really explain the differences between the standard and experimental therapies, the latter of which is composed of a sort of physical \u201cdesensitization\u201d to feared physical movements; and fails to offer any details about the base level of the subjects\u2019 pain, how pain was measured, or why the researchers looked for (and didn\u2019t find) brain changes in the study group. We were glad the article included an outside expert, who makes clear that the experimental intervention is time intensive, costly, not covered by insurance and \u00a0\u2014 although \u201cpromising\u201d \u2014 still unproven with respect to long-term benefit compared to standard therapies. That provided some much needed information for the reader. (Note: Due to an editing error, this story originally was marked with a 2-star score.

By emphasizing that \u201churt doesn\u2019t mean harm,\u201d the hope is that patients will become more active and that activity may actually reduce pain. This \u201cpain catastrophizing\u201d theory is not really new. As such the description of this study doesn\u2019t make clear what is different from prior studies evaluating this approach.

The study of 38 men with abdominal obesity took place over a 12-week period and compared the effects of either a high carbohydrate or a high fat diet. This study, though randomized, only measured markers of risk such as blood pressure and triglycerides (not actual heart disease) for a short period of time. Current recommendations regarding fat intake are based on actual rates of heart disease found in large groups of people followed for years. It\u2019s not unreasonable to raise questions about the role of saturated fat in heart disease. Researchers readily acknowledge that existing studies on the issue have important limitations. However, this release goes too far in describing the significance of this single small study, and gives no acknowledgment to evidence that cuts the other way.

{"claim_id":"9256","claim":"FDA Clears P-Cure Upright Imaging Solution  for Proton Therapy Enhancement","explanation":"P-Cure Ltd. device We\u2019re fully prepared to believe that there are ways to more accurately administer proton beam therapy with fewer side effects and lower costs. This release makes just those claims and yet provides nothing to back the claims up. There is no quantification of benefits. No true exploration of risks. No explanation of the quality of the evidence. And no true comparison of alternatives. The release muddies the water on what kind of nod it got from the US\u2019s regulatory agency. The company received FDA \u201cclearance\u201d to market the device but not an \u201capproval.\u201d (See the discussion under the Quality of Evidence criteria.) Proton beam therapy represents an alternative form of radiotherapy compared to conventional x-rays. Interest in this form of therapy has grown based upon its ability to deliver higher doses of radiation to a smaller field. This may improve the benefit and reduce the harm for patients with cancer who need radiotherapy. Although not a focus in this release, the proven outcomes of proton vs. conventional radiotherapy in terms of benefits (increased survival) and harms (less damage to surrounding normal tissue) are less clear than the proponents of proton therapy would like to admit. For many cancers, conventional therapy may be adequate. Here the question is whether the delivery of proton beam therapy to patients who are getting it can be enhanced by delivering the treatment to the patient in a seated compared to a flat position. One can imagine for some patients that may lead to a more comfortable treatment, but it isn\u2019t clear how many would derive a measurable benefit.

The release neglects to point out that even after this phase 2 trial has been completed, researchers won\u2019t know if the experimental drug cocktail is better or worse than standard treatments, because it does not include any direct comparison. The release puffs up the threat of multiple myeloma, which accounts for less than 2 percent of cancer cases in the US. It does not explain that patients would be responsible for many of the costs of this treatment, in part because of overlaps with standard care. The release does report support from pharmaceutical companies that make two of the drugs to be used. The lead investigator of this trial, Luciano Costa, MD, gave an interview in which he clearly pointed out much of the important information that is missing from the news release. The interview shows that the researchers are aware of the limitations of the evidence and of their trial. Costa pointed out that patients considering enrolling would be responsible for a share of the costs of treatment. Researchers have a responsibility to ensure that news releases issued about their work give readers a fair summary, not the kind of rosy depiction in this release. It\u2019s also important to point out that this is a phase 2 trial, which identifies safety and effectiveness of a treatment.

{"claim_id":"10058","claim":"Study Questions Chiropractic\u2019s Impact on Back Pain","explanation":"The article focused on a recent systematic review of the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain. The Cochrane Collaboration review found that this popular treatment leads to rapid short-term pain relief and improvement in function. But the magnitude of the treatment effect was modest at best. And manipulation did not provide a \u201cclinically significant\u201d advantage over other common treatments for chronic low back pain, according to this review. The HealthDay article made a key observation about chronic back pain: that there is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d for it. And it provided a brief but fair description of the systematic review and the evidence it considered. Our reviewers could have gone either way on several of the graded criteria, so the 4-star final score may be a bit deceiving. What were some of the shortcomings of this article? The article had a misleading title: \u201cStudy Questions Chiropractic\u2019s Impact on Back Pain\u201d. This systematic review looked at the effects of manipulation as practiced by multiple professions rather than the impact of chiropractic per se. Since the review concluded that manipulation is a viable treatment for chronic back pain, one can argue that it supports rather than questions this manual therapy. It might have been useful to ask an impartial expert how the new review on manipulation compares with other recent reviews of the evidence in this area. And how manipulation compares with other effective treatments for chronic back pain. Readers of this article might well have come away with the impression that all treatments for chronic back pain offer similar results. This is not the case. Of the 200 or so therapies for chronic back pain in the medical marketplace, no treatment consistently offers a major benefit. Only a few have been proven to provide a moderate benefit for chronic back pain. The most influential U.S. guideline found only six treatments, including manipulation, where there was \u201cgood\u201d evidence of a \u201cmoderate benefit\u201d for chronic back pain (See Chou et al., 2007; Chou et al., 2009). An influential British review concluded that three general approaches (exercise, manual therapy including manipulation, and acupuncture) provide roughly equal benefit in the early management of persistent back pain. (See NICE, 2009). So the new review on manipulation is\u00a0reasonably consistent with the larger evidence picture. It would have been useful if the article could have highlighted this point\u2014since it offers an important message for people with chronic back pain. Based on this body of evidence, they shouldn\u2019t be expecting heroic cures. Rather, they should look for validated treatments that can help them stay comfortable and active\u2014and that align with their values, expectations and tolerance for risk.

The 2007 National Health Interview Survey concluded that roughly 8.6% of U.S. adults\u2014close to 20 million individuals\u2014utilized chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation. Despite its popularity, spinal manipulation is still commonly referred to as a \u201ccomplementary\/alternative\u201d therapy rather than a mainstream treatment. Though it enjoys considerable support in systematic reviews and guidelines, spinal manipulation remains somewhat controversial and is not widely available in primary care medical settings. It does not enjoy completely consistent support from insurance companies. So determining the optimal role of manipulation in the management of chronic low back pain\u2014in both chiropractic and conventional medical settings\u2014 is an important priority.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":"11021","claim":"Fertility supplements may help some women conceive","explanation":"Getting pregnant is harder than most women realize, but that doesn\u2019t mean that if it takes time, there is something wrong that must be treated or dealt with. Furthermore, conception is a serendipitous process that isn\u2019t fully under our control, although you wouldn\u2019t know that from the myriad of products available. In the US, fertility treatment is a big business. This story describes one type of supplement for fertility support that includes a wide variety of ingredients. The story quotes many of the claims made on the company\u2019s website but injects some amount of healthy skepticism. This relatively short story includes valuable information, such as the availability and cost of the supplements. It provides details on one study evaluating the supplement but could have commented on whether these results have been validated by other studies. It quantifies the results of that one study but is careful not to make claims that the supplements improve fertility by X or Y%, which is appropriate given how small the study was. The story quotes more than one expert, one who works for the company and one who does not. This independent source is crucial in this story and provides much-needed perspective. The story could have been improved by describing alternative options, other than to \"see a doctor\". For example, monitoring ovulation, quitting smoking and drinking, maintaining a healthy weight and managing stress and depression may help. Furthermore, the story does not mention any harms of the supplement, known or unknown. Even if the harms are not known, the story should have highlighted that. Side effects of chasteberry, an active ingredient in the supplements, can include nausea, headaches, GI disturbances, and menstrual cycle irregularities.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"11296","claim":"Single Dose of Hallucinogenic Drug Psilocybin Relieves Anxiety and Depression in Patients with Advanced Cancer","explanation":"This release focuses on a recent study that found a single application of the hallucinogen psilocybin is effective at providing meaningful relief to cancer patients suffering from severe depression or anxiety. The release notes that 80 percent of participants showed improvement based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression for several months following the treatment. The study is one of two on the subject that were published recently in the Journal of Psychopharmacology (our review of the release for the other study can be found here and a review of a related news article can be read here.) The release does better than its counterpart in terms of addressing conflicts of interest and placing the work in context with previous work in the field. However, the release uses only vague language when addressing the key issues of health benefits and adverse side effects. More specifics on the degree of reduced anxiety and depression scores would have been useful. Because this study and its counterpart offer an intriguing finding \u2014 that a single dose of something could be so helpful in alleviating depression \u2014 we\u2019ve completed three reviews related to these studies: one on a news story from the LA Times, one on a news release from Johns Hopkins, and this review on the release from NYU. And the core issues involved are similar across all three items. Cancer is a widespread health problem that affects many millions of Americans. According to the National Cancer Institute, just under 1.7 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2016 alone. If you consider that each of those people has a family and loved ones who are also affected by the diagnosis, you can begin to appreciate the scope of the problem. According to a report from the National Institutes of Health\u2019s 2002 State-of-the-Science Conference on Symptom Management in Cancer: Pain, Depression, and Fatigue, \u201cThe clinical \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 is that 25 percent of cancer patients are likely depressed enough at some point in the course of disease to warrant evaluation and treatment.\u201d This makes it especially important for research institutions and news outlets to write responsibly about studies like those discussed in this release. You want to give readers enough information to help them make informed decisions. You don\u2019t want to raise false hopes, or sensationalize the work. We think all three summaries on this growing body of research reported responsibly on the findings.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9720","claim":"Talk Therapy Found to Ease Schizophrenia","explanation":"Update: The Times has issued a correction to this story. The correction states that the story erroneously claimed that the experimental approach in the study used lower drug dosages. \u201cThough it studied a program intended to reduce medication dosages, the researchers do not yet know for sure if dosages were lowered or by how much,\u201d the correction notes.\u201dTherefore, the study did not conclude \u2018that schizophrenia patients who received smaller doses of antipsychotic medication and a bigger emphasis on one-on-one talk therapy and family support made greater strides in recovery.\u2019 (The study did conclude that the alternative treatment program as a whole led to better outcomes. )\u201d We changed the headline of our review from \u201cTimes captures impact of new, less drug-intensive schizophrenia treatment\u201d to \u201cTimes explores impact of integrated care model for schizophrenia treatment.\u201d The correction does not affect our ratings for the story, but the references we made in the review to the lowered drug dosages are no longer appropriate and have been stricken. In addition, the tone of the review would have been more circumspect had we known that the intended reduction in drug dosages had not been confirmed by the researchers. In a large randomized controlled trial in\u00a034 community clinics\u00a0across the U.S., researchers compared usual care for first episode psychosis with a program of integrated care that included not only drugs, but also help with school and work, family education about the problems and how best to help, as well as one-on-one talk therapy. The government (National Institute of Mental Health)-funded study found that those receiving the integrated program of care experienced more symptom relief and functioned better than those in the treatment-as-usual group. Their doses of medication were also 20-50% lower. Those receiving treatment earlier on in their psychotic episodes also did better. The story overall does a solid job of covering the study and its implications. But we wish it had pushed a bit harder to quantify the benefits shown in the 2-year trial with some hard numbers. We applaud the discussion of federal policy and financing, but also wish there had been some discussion of the costs of therapy itself. The inclusion of a variety of perspectives on the research brings depth and nuance to the coverage. Psychiatric treatment in the U.S. has become very drug focused. Other countries are ahead of us on using more integrated care models like the one described in this story, so it\u2019s great to see its success \u201cproven\u201d with a randomized trial. With solid evidence to back it, this model will hopefully become a more accepted approach to practice in the U.S.","label":"true"}

So a headline that says \u201cstudies find benefit\u201d is wrong. You can\u2019t prove benefit when you can\u2019t establish a causal link. There was no evaluation of the quality of the evidence. Without knowing the screening history and risk factor profile of the aceteminophen users, it is very difficult to interpret the observed association. Cancer progression is a very heterogeneous endpoint and the article did not address this issue or report meaningful results (absolute risk).

{"claim_id":"10756","claim":"Hormone therapy raises risk quickly, study finds","explanation":"The focus of this story is a report of new data showing a statistically significant association between lobular breast cancer and short-term HRT (3 years or less). The story creates an exaggerated sense of risk\u00a0because\u00a0there is no mention of absolute risk. For breast cancer, estimated excess risk is 8 women\/10,000 women per year developing breast cancer after 4 years of combined HRT use as compared with no hormone use. A current treatment approach for bothersome menopausal symptoms is a course of low-dose HRT for 3-5 years with frequent monitoring. This course of treatment is considered safe for most women not already at high risk of developing breast cancer. The clinician interviewed stresses frequent monitoring and an individualized approach to managing symptoms. The story notes various combinations of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\u00a0 available for reducing menopaual symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. However, there is no discussion that menopause is a natural part of aging and unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause such as hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness and discomfort. The story does strike a balance by interviewing the lead author of the study and a gynecologist who put the new information in clinical perspective. It would be\u00a0helpful to hear from researchers of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative\u00a0for comment on how their data on breast cancer risk compared to the present study.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The confusion arises around what is being tested: is it the progesterone, the nCyclinE molecular marker or the Endometrial Function Test (EFT) used in this experiment to identify a subset of women who would benefit from progesterone? Our reviewers were baffled and readers likely will be, too. Progesterone has been clinically used to prevent unexplained early miscarriage. Some early meta-analyses had suggested a reduction in miscarriages, but later trials showed no difference. If you are going to make a claim that progesterone prevents miscarriage, you should have more than a 116-person study to back up that claim. Preventing miscarriages could be a major public health advance and have a very profound effect on the lives of parents and families. If a cheap, safe and effective treatment could be prescribed to prevent untimely deaths of fetuses that would be welcome news. Potential mothers who have experienced the pain of miscarriage, however, should not be inadvertently led astray from headlines that promise miscarriage prevention without adequate study of the safety and effectiveness of that treatment.

The study compared the new test with a more complex, and expensive, alternative and measures whether the new test works better in patients who are HIV-positive and\/or who are vaccinated with the Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine. The release provides adequate data for readers to trust its claims but doesn\u2019t mention funding sources or address whether there was any potential for conflicts of interest. To its credit, however, the release includes a basic research abstract providing more detailed information on the results from the trials. Tuberculosis is a serious problem worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) has a stated goal of controlling, if not eradicating, the disease by 2035. As is noted, the most often used test (TST) is associated with a high false positive rate making inappropriate treatment more likely.

{"claim_id":"8984","claim":"Older patients with knee pain may benefit from allograft transplant technique","explanation":"The news release focuses on a small-scale study comparing the outcomes of osteochondral allograft transplantation \u2014 a technique that replaces damaged knee cartilage with healthy cartilage from a donor. The researchers used the technique to treat knee pain in two groups of patients: those over the age of forty and those under the age of forty. Specifically, the release reports that osteochondral allograft transplantation \u2014 sometimes in conjunction with additional surgery \u2014 can be an effective treatment for older adults. However, the release offers little detailed information. For example, it fails to address costs, potential harms, or quantified benefits related to the procedure. It also didn\u2019t explain that the control group used in the study wasn\u2019t really adequate to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. Knee pain is a common complaint that increases with age. In older individuals, symptoms are often related to arthritis due to \u201cwear and tear\u201d over time. Problems with the cartilage that covers the bone are thought to be a common factor that contributes to these arthritic changes. If the cartilage is lost in certain places, the result is bone on bone irritation without the protective surface that the cartilage provides. There are many causes for developing cartilage defects, but one is prior knee surgery, commonly arthroscopic (\u201cscope\u201d) procedures done to repair tears in the pad (meniscus) that cushion the knee bones. That is why most patients in this study had a history of prior surgery. Treatment for cartilage damage has focused on ways to regrow it so that the defects can be repaired. This study reports on one such procedure. The key issue evaluated here is the age of the patient. This is important because with increasing age the cartilage problems get worse and don\u2019t respond to repair attempts. So studies demonstrating similar benefit in older compared to younger patients may be important. But it is also important to know that even in younger patients, such techniques haven\u2019t been shown in high quality studies to really work, especially in longer-term follow-up studies. Thus saying that outcomes were similar in younger and older patients may mislead readers by overlooking the generally limited evidence of success, especially over time, in younger patients.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":"9565","claim":"Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies","explanation":"This is a brief\u00a0story looking at\u00a0a systematic review of 146 other studies, concluding that there is likely some reduction in risk of allergy to eggs and peanuts if infants get those foods for the first time between 4-6 months, instead of later. The\u00a0review lends more evidence to the theory that some allergies can be avoided, paradoxically, by exposing children earlier to the allergen, such as peanuts or eggs. But this is not the final word, and the researchers make that clear in their review, stating, \u201cthese systematic review findings should not automatically lead to new recommendations to feed egg and peanut to all infants.\u201d This viewpoint is missing from the TIME story, which headlined this story with a very conclusive statement: \u201cBabies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies.\u201d \u00a0 Food allergies are common and on the rise in the U.S. Parents deserve more context and some of the caveats behind why the researchers caution against a blanket recommendation.","label":"false"}

(75 percent of all children experience once by age 3.) Parents suffer, children suffer, and money is spent.

{"claim_id":"11375","claim":"Getting the focus back: There\u2019s new hope for people with age-related macular degeneration","explanation":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a significant cause of blindness in the elderly and is becoming more common as the population ages. There are two major kinds of AMD, \"wet\" or neovascular and \"dry.\" Although the \"wet\" form is much less common than \"dry\", it is much more likely to lead to blindness, which can occur very suddenly. Until recently, wet AMD was treated with lasers or phototherapy, however in June, 2006 the FDA approved the drug Lucentis for the condition. This story reports on advancements in treatment of AMD but then goes on to talk about developments in treating cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. This review will focus on the discussion of treating wet AMD with Lucentis, which comprises the first five paragraphs of this story. By not\u00a0exaggerating the seriousness of wet AMD, the story avoids disease mongering. The story should have provided some sense of the prevalence of wet AMD, which is relatively rare compared to the more common dry AMD. The story mentions Avastin, laser treatment, and phototherapy as alternatives. The story could have provided more information on the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. The story does mention the increased risk of strokes with Lucentis, however the story should have also mentioned risk of inflammation and infection from injection into the eye. The story does not mention the cost of Lucentis, which is substantial, up to $2000 per injection. Since the injections need to be\u00a0given monthly for an indefinite amount of time, cost is a\u00a0major issue and has the potential to be a signficant barrier to obtaining the drug. The story does mention that Avastin is a much cheaper alternative, but this is not enough information on the cost of treatment. The story does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence, nor does it quantify the benefits of Lucentis. Finally, the story only quotes one expert and one satisfied patient who happens to be a physician. The story should have quoted other clinicians\/researchers who could have provided some additional perspective.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"10993","claim":"Pushing Limits of New Knees","explanation":"This article looked at this issue through the positive short-term experiences of six individuals who opted for joint replacement in mid-life. They all seemed to be exuberantly active and have splendid outcomes after emerging from post-operative rehabilitation. The six recipients of artificial knees and hips were collectively able to engage in long-distance cycling, kite-boarding, motorcycling, yoga, pilates, strength training and basketball. One woman reported that her pain and limitations were completely gone. \u201cI never imagined my life could be so wonderful,\u201d she commented. Although several of the subjects were pushing the envelope in terms of stressing their implanted joints with high-impact activities, not a single one reported a problem, a complication, or a functional limitation when they returned to normal activity. In a country where more than half of adults are overweight, and almost half are completely sedentary, the joint replacement patients in the Wall St. Journal article are far from the norm. It is hard to imagine that these six individuals are representative of patients who opt for joint replacement in middle age across the United States. The story did attempt to balance the idealized view of joint replacement in the patient vignettes with cautionary notes from several surgeons. These invited experts pointed out that artificial joint recipients should avoid high-impact sports and that the durability of joints implanted in mid-life remains uncertain. Given the views of these experts, some tough questioning of the patients could have shown the reader that these individuals may be experiencing short-term benefits at the expense of long-term misery\u2014if their implants ultimately fail. More references to scientific studies would have been welcome. The article never reported the overall success rate of knee and hip replacement in younger patients. Or the degree to which these procedures lead to an increased level of activity. It gave short shrift to one of the key questions about joint replacement in middle-age. In terms of pain, function, and adverse advents, what are the projected outcomes of the revision procedures that appear to be inevitable for surgeries performed at this age? And the article never got into the thorny question as to whether the surge in knee and hip replacement in younger patients might represent over-utilization of these surgical procedures\u2014or at least premature use. A recent commentary in Arthritis Care & Research suggested that patients and their doctors in the United States rely excessively on analgesics and joint replacement to treat osteoarthritis of the knee and hip\u2014and are under-utilizing evidence-based treatments, such as weight loss and exercise programs, that might delay these operations. (See Hunter et al., 2011). Reference: Hunter DJ et al., Quality of osteoarthritis management and the need for reform in the U.S., Arthritis Care & Research, 2011; 63(1): 31-38. Although knee and hip replacement have traditionally been employed in patients 65 and older, there has been a recent expansion in their utilization in younger patients, particularly those in their 40s and 50s. Since patients this age will likely require one or more revision procedures over the course of their lifetimes, this creates uncertainty about the long-term outcomes of knee and hip replacement in this population. There is also evidence that healthcare practitioners in the United States are not following evidence-based guidelines in the treatment of painful osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, particularly in its early stages. As a result, some patients may be undergoing joint replacement unnecessarily. (See Hunter et al., 2011). Given the \u201cgraying\u201d of the general population, and the rising prevalence of painful OA, these are huge public health issues.

{"claim_id":"11446","claim":"Abaloparatide may help prevent fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis","explanation":"This release from The Endocrine Society describes the results of one of a series of randomized, double-blind comparative clinical trials of abaloparatide-SC, an investigational drug designed to increase bone mineral density and prevent bone fractures in postmenopausal women who have osteoporosis and who already had suffered one fracture. The study was presented as a poster presentation at the Society\u2019s recent conference. The release helpfully \u2014 and carefully \u2014 notes early that the research is \u201cindustry sponsored.\u201d The release did a good job discussing the study design and results but didn\u2019t address potential cost and harms. Some health organizations estimate more than 200 million women (and men) worldwide have osteoporosis and that in the United States, 43 million adults are at risk for osteoporosis and that the disease is responsible for about 2 million broken bones each year. Various prescription treatments are on the market designed to increase bone mineral density and either prevent fractures in the first place or reduce the risk of a subsequent one. Exercise, diet and lifestyle also are involved in risk factor prevention and modification, and all of the prescription drugs carry risks for some women of serious side effects, including higher than usual risks for a rare form of bone cancer, kidney stones, weakness, respiratory infections, and dizziness. The costs of some treatments also are high. Thus, any news of additional drug treatments will be of significant interest to millions of women and men.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"10330","claim":"Cancer drug 49 times more potent than Cisplatin","explanation":"This University of Warwick release promises much more than it should, considering the research was conducted not on humans or even mice but on cell lines in labs.

The drug certainly faces a very long and uncertain road before it might be approved for use in actual cancer patients \u2014 something the release never warned readers about. This is interesting research that\u2019s worth writing about, but the release desperately needed a statement cluing readers in to the very preliminary nature of the study.

{"claim_id":"10417","claim":"New heart attack test could identify two-thirds of patients at very low risk of heart attack in the emergency department","explanation":"This news release describes the results of a study designed to significantly advance the search for a rapid blood test that can rule out evidence of heart muscle damage in people who come to emergency rooms with chest pain and other symptoms of heart attack. The study, reported in the journal The Lancet, specifically offers\u00a0compelling evidence that a version of a commonly used blood test may indeed further that quest. For the study, investigators used a highly sensitive version of an existing blood test that detects the protein troponin on more than 6,300\u00a0consecutive people presenting to hospital emergency rooms (mostly in Scotland) with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The researchers were able to determine the probability that patients were NOT at risk of heart attack or death from heart attack after 30 days for a range of troponin levels. The release does a generally adequate job of describing\u00a0how the high-sensitivity test appears to identify very low levels of troponin, in contrast to current troponin tests, thus making it theoretically possible to accurately, relatively quickly, and safely rule out a heart attack in more than 60 percent of such people, at least over the short term. It covers the fact that conventional troponin testing detects only higher levels of the protein, and must be done on serial blood samples over a longer period of time. And the news release puts appropriate emphasis on the potential the new test has for decreasing unnecessary hospitalizations and reducing health care costs. All that said, the release could have done a much better job of making clear earlier in the text that substantially more research will be needed to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of relying heavily on high-sensitivity troponin testing. Although the release uses qualifiers such as \u201cmay have been eligible for early safe discharge,\u201d we think more needed to be said about potential risks, about the potential\u00a0costs of the more sensitive test; and most of all about the limitations of the study and over-reliance on any single test when people experience heart attack symptoms. Patients arriving at emergency facilities with chest pain is a common and costly situation that is associated with potentially devastating consequences when the evaluation isn\u2019t done in a thorough fashion. The current evaluation of chest pain involves a history focused on the patient\u2019s reported symptoms and past history of heart disease and risk factors as well as tests performed. These include an electrical test of the heart (EKG or electrocardiogram) and blood tests looking for damage to heart muscle. This evaluation has been standard for decades, but better blood tests over time have allowed emergency providers to more accurately and quickly identify patients who may be having a heart attack. At the same time, the use of these newer tests has permitted providers to more quickly identify those who are not having a heart attack, allowing for earlier discharge from the emergency facility or hospital. The study reported in this news release seeks to define the threshold below which\u00a0a new, more sensitive test identifies people who are at low risk for heart attack or heart related death over the next 30 days. If confirmed, this will be a positive step forward in effectively and efficiently evaluating patients with chest pain in emergency facilities. However, the main limitation of this study is that it is using information previously collected to predict what would have happened if this new test and threshold was used. Only with prospective use and evaluation can we actually determine if this new test and threshold, when applied as part of routine care, leads to improved care and more efficient use of emergency and hospital resources.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9168","claim":"Common antibiotic may help to prevent or treat PTSD","explanation":"This University College London news release describes a complex piece of research that combines cell cultures, human volunteers, a theory that enzymatic proteins called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors are involved in forming threat memories inherent in PTSD, and that a common antibiotic may prevent their formation by blocking the\u00a0enzymes. The fact that the research was a theoretical proof-of concept is buried deep in the release so readers might think, based on the headline and earlier paragraphs alone, that the evidence is stronger than it is. The published research article describes some of the uncertainties involved in biopsychological investigations in animal models and people, but the release doesn\u2019t mention any of them, nor does it include any meaningful numbers to describe the benefits. It does raise the issue of the practicality of using drugs to prevent PTSD since no one can predict when a traumatic event will occur. The search for the neurochemical and biological roots of PTSD and other kinds of crippling anxieties is a scientific challenge\u00a0for good reason. The human \u201cmind\u201d is difficult to access; animal models are notoriously unreliable; and experiments on people designed to induce, evoke, or otherwise probe such trauma may be unethical. The work described here may indeed be\u00a0an important early step in understanding the role of signaling pathways outside of nerve cells in creating PTSD, and of novel\u00a0strategies using an already widely available set of drugs to sabotage\u00a0that role. But a lot more research will be needed to affirm the idea and a release on the research should make that point very clear and very high up in the text. When and if the blocking of a conditioned fear response by a drug is proven, who would want to take a long term drug in case a terrible event befalls them in the future? That would be taking \u201cpreventive medicine\u201d to a whole new level.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":"11335","claim":"Proton therapy controls common pediatric brain tumor with fewer long-term side effects","explanation":"This news release summarizes findings from an observational study that looks at the long-term side effects of treating childhood brain tumors with proton radiotherapy compared with the more standard photon therapy. The premise of the study and its follow-up release is that proton beam therapy, by damaging less normal brain tissue, leaves a young patent with fewer long-term future complications from side effects. The study, published in Lancet Oncology, reports on the follow-up of 59 children treated at one institution with proton beam therapy between 2003 and 2009. The release imparts a lot of information about the complicated study in a brief, readable way, but we have several concerns with missing information and implied results. All of the patients in the study had additional treatments including surgery and chemotherapy, so the benefits and harms cannot be fully attributed to the proton beam therapy. The release also does not address costs (which are significantly higher than standard therapy) or a very important limitation explained in the study which is that, for ethical reasons, there is no randomized control group treated in a similar way except for receiving conventional radiation therapy. Treating cancer\u00a0at any age is a challenging task for doctors, but when it involves children the stakes can\u2019t be higher. This is particularly the case when the cancer is in a sensitive location, in this case the child\u2019s brain, and when it can be life threatening, such as medulloblastoma. The treatments need to be strong enough to provide long-term management and at the same time spare normal surrounding tissue. When that surrounding tissue is the brain of a young child, damage can lead to life-long, serious complications. Studies that purport to offer improved outcomes need attention and scrutiny.","label":"MISLEADING"}

This matters because this is a non-drug treatment for certain headaches that can be very disabling.

{"claim_id":"11582","claim":"Hormone patch shows benefit over pill","explanation":"In 2002, the publication of the results of\u00a0Women's Health Initiative (WHI) fundamentally changed how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was used in the U.S. The study was halted early because of the finding of increased risk of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and clots from HRT use. The\u00a0reaction was a dramatic decrease in the number of women using HRT. This story reports on a study\u00a0published in this week's Circulation showing that using\u00a0estrogen in the form of a skin patch may\u00a0not\u00a0cause the increased risk of\u00a0blood clots that is associated with the use of\u00a0hormones in the pill form. This story does an excellent job of explaining the current study, describing other studies that have shown similar results, and outlining some of the problems with drawing firm conclusions from an observational trial. Furthermore, the story does an adequate job of describing the availability, novelty and harms of hormone therapy. Because the story quotes multiple, independent experts, the reader can assume the story does not rely on a press release as the sole source of information. The story did an especially good job of noting possible conflicts of interest in researchers. However, the story should have quantified the risk of blood clots\u00a0in absolute terms, not relative terms. The story states that \"women who took hormone pills were 4 times as likely to suffer a serious blood clot.\" Four times higher than what? The story could have provided more context for the reader on these numbers by giving the actual risk of clotting from the pills compared to the patch.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"10320","claim":"Shot Might One Day Help Lower Cholesterol","explanation":"We liked that this story was cautious about\u00a0predicting whether or how an experimental new cholesterol-lowering drug called AMG 145 might be useful for preventing heart disease. But there were a few missed opportunities to provide additional context, particularly regarding the\u00a0cost of the new drug (which will likely be very high) should it ever make\u00a0it to market\u00a0and the fact that the outcome measured in this study (LDL cholesterol) is only a marker of heart disease risk that may not reflect\u00a0a reduction in actual heart attacks. As this story points out, there are many factors which can make it difficult for patients to take\u00a0cholesterol-lowering statin medication. Some patients are troubled by statin-related muscle pain, while others simply aren\u2019t disciplined enough to take their daily dose of medicine as directed. Other patients may never achieve their target for LDL cholesterol reduction\u00a0despite taking the highest available statin dose.

{"claim_id":"35539","claim":"By spring 2020, the sun had entered a \"lockdown\" period where its solar activity decreased to the point that famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather threatened life on Earth.","explanation":"What's true: Solar activity, which is often defined by the amount of sunspots on the star's surface, pendulates on a roughly 11-year cycle.

{"claim_id":"10580","claim":"Fewer mammograms means more breast cancer deaths","explanation":"This broadcast describes data from two recent government reports showing that fewer women are undergoing mammograms and fewer mammography centers are in business today than a few years ago. It quotes one expert who says this means that more women will therefore die of breast cancer. Few would argue that all women should have access to mammography. However, the broadcast provides no evidence to support the dire conclusion of the expert that more deaths will ensue. It also fails to balance this view with information about the potential harms of mammography. And it neglects to note that the GAO report says that current capacity is \u201clikely adequate.\u201d \u00a0What is the quality of evidence on this complex topic? There is no way to tell from the broadcast whether the scientific evidence supports the view that fewer mammograms will categorically result in more cancer deaths, nor any attempt to weigh this against the evidence that mammography may produce harms as well as benefits. Most experts believe that mammography in women aged 50 to 69 saves lives; its benefit in those younger and older is controversial. But like other cancer screens, improved survival among women who undergo mammography may be deceiving. It is possible, for example, that screened patients do not actually live longer than unscreened patients do, but simply appear to live longer because they\u00a0receive a diagnosis earlier. It is also possible that mammography will actually cause harm. Exposure to radiation during mammography could itself cause breast cancer 10 or 20 years down the road. (Br J Cancer 2005;93:590-6. Lancet 2000;355:1757-70) In addition, mammograms increase the diagnosis of lesions. Left untreated, some of these will become cancers, but many will not. The discovery of a lesion leads not only to fear and anxiety, but also to invasive diagnostic tests and invasive treatments (including mastectomy or lumpectomy) that inflict additional emotional and physical harm. \u201cFor every woman who has her life extended by screening,\u201d writes the Cochrane Center\u2019s Peter Gotzsche in Denmark, \u201cthere are at least five women who will be diagnosed with, and treated for, cancer unnecessarily.\u201d (Lancet 2005;366;1519-20) One learns nothing about these potential harms in the ABC News broadcast. Because medicine does not yet have perfect estimates of the harms of mammography, some would say there is no simple \u201cright\u201d recommendation for every patient. The only possible blanket recommendation might be for clinicians\u2013and the news media\u2013to explain the potential benefits and harms, and thus help women to evaluate their own individual tolerance for risk and preferences so that they can choose the course of action that best suits them. News organizations that choose to cover medicine should explain the quality of the evidence and the pros and cons surrounding any medical procedure well enough for patients to understand what is known and what remains unknown. Unfortunately, instead of an even-handed analysis, this broadcast promotes fear.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"13006","claim":"Activities by foreign governments had \"absolutely no effect on the outcome of this election.","explanation":"After meeting with senior intelligence officials about the details of a soon-to-be-released report on alleged Russian hacking, Trump said that activities by foreign governments had \"absolutely no effect on the outcome of this election.\" Trump can use the intelligence report to bolster this assertion only in one limited way -- that Russia did not succeed in tampering with vote counts (though it appears to have tried). On the broader issue of whether Russia had any impact on the outcome of the election, the report specifically noted that it didn\u2019t address this issue, and Clapper in his Senate testimony didn\u2019t either. Saying there was no Russian ballot-tampering is not the same thing as saying there was no Russian influence on the election. Political scientists say it\u2019s impossible to move beyond informed speculation about whether there was a Russian impact on the election\u2019s outcome -- or, importantly, whether there wasn\u2019t an impact.

{"claim_id":"8952","claim":"Getting relief from sexual dysfunction and incontinence caused by menopause","explanation":"This news release summarizes an observational study on the benefits of CO2 ablative laser treatments for reducing menopausal symptoms like vaginal dryness\/itching\/burning, painful intercourse, frequent urinating, or incontinence in 94 post-menopausal women. While the release makes the claim that the study \u201cdemonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness,\u201d it was an observational study which cannot show cause-and-effect. The release notes that this intervention is a subject of debate among experts, and that more studies are needed to confirm the long term efficacy and safety of this approach. It falls short in several areas: it neglects to mention that the FDA warns against using lasers for menopause symptoms, excludes any data from the study, and omits disclosure of significant financial conflicts of interest among study authors and the organization that distributed the release, the North American Menopause Society. It\u2019s estimated that around half of post-menopausal women have at least one of the aforementioned constellation of symptoms that some doctors label \u201cgenitourinary symptoms of menopause,\u201d or GSM, and others see as normal (but problematic) symptoms of a low estrogen state. Some women respond well to symptomatic treatment, others may choose hormone replacement, and some struggle to find relief. It\u2019s important to point out that many women seek no treatment at all. For women interested in treatment, finding reliable information can be problematic. Thorough and thoughtful news releases and news coverage should, at the very least, provide:\u00a0 good data balancing the benefits and potential harms, give a sense of safety and efficacy in comparison to other existing treatments, seek out independent experts not involved in the highlighted study, as well as fully disclose if that study could be biased by conflicts of interest.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"11526","claim":"Breast Cancer Drug Breakthrough","explanation":"This story reports on a potentially important development in the prevention of breast cancer among high risk, postmenopausal women. The story is clear that this is an existing drug for osteoporosis that has not been approved by the FDA for use in breast cancer prevention. The story also does not make claims about when it may be approved for that purpose. There is no obvious disease mongering; the story accurately represents the prevalence and seriousness of breast cancer  Although there is mention of a clinical trial, the story does not describe the study design. Also not mentioned was the fact that the results have not yet been published or peer reviewed, so interpretation of the clinical significance of these results are difficult at this time. Benefits of treatment are quantified in relative terms only. The viewer is told that raloxifene and tamoxifen both reduce the incidence of breast cancer by about 50%, however there is no context provided for these numbers. Most viewers would want to know \u201c50% of what?\u201d They want the absolute risk reduction. Viewers should have been told that even though the women in the study were high risk, the incidence of breast cancer over 5 years was still very low. The story also does not mention that raloxifene does not reduce the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, which tamoxifen does), so it is not clear that when the story says the benefits are equivalent between the two drugs, if it will hold true if they include all breast cancer events (including DCIS, which is found quite commonly these days). The story also omits an important fact: the decrease in incidence of uterine cancer and clots in the raloxifene group was not statistically different from the tamoxifen group. Although uterine cancer and blood clots are mentioned as harms of treatment, there is no mention of how often they occur. Other harms such as cataracts and stroke are not mentioned. No costs are mentioned. According to the website for the STAR trial, the cost of Raloxifene is about $75 per month, while Tamoxifen costs about $100 per month. Because these drugs have to be taken for long periods of time, cost is an important issue.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9516","claim":"CAR-T therapy makes early inroads in treating brain cancer","explanation":"This story\u00a0in STAT, like the one in TIME.com that we also reviewed, describes the successful, and apparently first positive response of a glioblastoma brain tumor to CAR-T therapy. This is an experimental immunotherapy that depends on on injections of modified immune cell proteins and that has had a few successes in blood cancers but essentially none in solid tumors, including those in the brain. Described in a report in the\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine, the study was conducted and promoted by officials and physicians at the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center, an organization that has a somewhat unfortunate history of touting treatments as bringing about\u00a0\u201cmiracles\u201d and encouraging coverage of compelling individual cancer patient stories to support sometimes exaggerated claims of major advances in cancer treatment. This STAT story does a better job than TIME of putting what is essentially a single, unexpected experimental result into perspective. Its strongest points are that it avoids touting this one patient\u2019s experience as any kind of broad \u201csuccess,\u201d calling it an \u201cearly inroad;\u2019 emphasizing its \u201cnotorious\u201d potential side effects; and most of all quoting sources outside City of Hope who made clear that, as one put it, the success was possibly a \u201cflash in the pan.\u201d Bravo.

{"claim_id":"9389","claim":"Modified Pap tests can show early warning signs of other gynecological cancers","explanation":"This story by the LA Times covers a study of PapSeek, which is a new three-prong genetic test for Pap smear, inner-uterus smear, and blood samples. The test aims to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers, which typically aren\u2019t found until they\u2019re advanced, limiting effective treatments options and contributing to the lethality. The story takes care to note the shortfalls of the alternatives, and how an effective early-detection screening could help thousands of women per year in the US alone. However, the story falters in very important ways. There\u2019s no mention that 27% of the study\u2019s authors could benefit financially from the administration and sale of PapSeek tests, doesn\u2019t appear to incorporate independent experts\u2019 perspectives on the study and its significance, and skips over any discussion of costs or potential harms. Pap smears have slashed cervical cancer death rates by more than 60% since their inception in 1955, bringing the death rate to about 4,000 American women per year. But endometrial cancers kill roughly 10,000 women and ovarian cancer nearly 14,000 women per year \u2014 and there\u2019s no widely accepted or effective screening method for early detection. This is especially important for ovarian cancer, as the lack of screening options have meant the numbers haven\u2019t nudged much. Even if a screening test is not as sensitive as direct biopsies of cancerous tissues, any test at all for endometrial or ovarian cancers may catch more cases earlier, help patients begin treatment sooner, and see longer remissions and lifespan.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9426","claim":"Antibiotics could dramatically reduce STIs, study says, raising tough new questions","explanation":"Getty Images This\u00a0is a\u00a0story about a test of using antibiotics right after sex to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men and use\u00a0no condoms. On the plus side, readers who stick with the story to the end are given many warnings from the researchers and independent sources about the risks of deploying such a strategy. In that respect this\u00a0is a very thoroughly reported story. However, the story implies the results may be relevant to the general population even though the people included in the study have a risk of syphilis, for example, that is more then 1,000 times higher than the general population. All men in the study were also taking antiviral prophylaxis against HIV infection. Much of our concern about the story stems from the overly broad headline, and we\u2019re the first to acknowledge that reporters often have little control over that key aspect of their work. Nevertheless, we think it\u2019s something that needs to be addressed if readers are to receive an accurate picture of the research and its relevance. This is an important topic because rates of sexually transmitted infections remain high, especially among high-risk populations, and a safe and effective means of preventing them would be big news. News stories such as this, however, should be very clear about the potential relevance of studies to general readers. A more complete description of the study population (and of the long history of other studies that have looked at using antibiotics to prevent sexually transmitted diseases) would have helped readers understand just how specific and limited the results of this study are.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"11466","claim":"Study: Safe hormone therapy after hysterectomy","explanation":"This story provides a brief overview of the results of the Estrogen-Alone study, which was a large, randomized, blinded trial and part of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The story accurately notes that estrogen-alone therapy is only for postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. The story provides some balance on the risks and benefits of taking estrogen alone to relieve symptoms of menopause, and there is caution that it is not right for certain women. There is discussion of some of the established benefits of HRT, such as relieving hot flashes and helping to prevent osteoporosis. However, there is no quantitative data from the study on how great a benefit HRT would provide. For example, in the estrogen alone study, there were only 6 fewer hip fractures (11 cases in estrogen alone and 17 cases in placebo group) out of tens of thousands of women enrolled. There is no discussion of other medications which are effectively used to prevent osteoporosis and have fewer health risks. The most erroneous portion of the story is the claim that \u201cwomen can take this form of HRT with worrying about breast cancer.\u201d It is true that there were fewer cases of breast cancer in the estrogen alone group: 28 per 10,000 in the estrogen group vs. 34 per 10,000 in the placebo group, and the difference was not statistically significant. However, there were more abnormal mammograms that required follow-up and 33% more breast biopsies in the estrogen alone group (747 vs. 549), which does not necessarily mean more breast cancer, but can signal changes in breast cells and tissue. Also, women at a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the estrogen-alone group had larger tumors that spread to the lymph nodes, which can mean a poorer prognosis and more breast cancer treatment. Lastly, there is no discussion that menopause is a natural part of aging and not a condition which necessitates medical intervention. Unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take hormone therapy medications to ease symptoms common in menopause such as hot flashes, cold sweats and vaginal dryness and discomfort. The report does not talk about less invasive alternative treatments for relieving symptoms of menopause such as exercise, vaginal creams, and wearing loose, cool clothing to prevent discomfort from hot flashes and cold sweats.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"11367","claim":"Drug effective in smoking cessation studies","explanation":"This news story was based on a report of two double-blind randomized studies comparing the newer drug, varenicline, with bupropion and placebo as aids to smoking cessation. This newer drug may help quell nicotine cravings by binding to receptors in the brain that control the release of dopamine, which is often stimulated by nicotine. More sustained levels of dopamine may help with cravings and withdrawal from nicotine. The studies discussed were both funded by Pfizer and reports of side effects were limited, as only nausea was listed and qualified as \u201cmild\u201d by the primary researcher. Despite the headline (\u201cDrug effective in smoking cessation studies\u201d), which we know is usually not written by the reporter, the journalists are appropriately cautious about the findings and provide information about the funding source and potential conflicts of interest. Abstinence rates at one year for each smoking cessation drug and placebo are presented; however, the news story lacks a comparison with abstinence rates for alternative (non-drug) methods of smoking cessation and does not provide enough information about the long-term risks of the newer drug or side effects. Longer-term data, larger controlled studies and more information on the safety of varenicline (vs. the more studied bupropion) are necessary before this drug is presented as a viable option for smoking cessation. Given that the drug has not yet been approved for smoking cessation in the U.S., the story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s generally positive tone fails to remind readers of hurdles still to be passed on the road to approval. For example, the drug\u2019s performance is not much better than published rates for bupropion (Zyban) in other randomized clinical trials designed to test the latter versus placebo.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":"10862","claim":"New Therapy Delivers Long-Term Relief for Chronic Back, Leg Pain, Study Finds","explanation":"The release reports on a study that tested a new type of implanted device for the treatment of chronic back and leg pain. It uses high-frequency electrical pulses, delivered directly to the spinal cord via implanted leads. The study compared this high-frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to a more traditional approach that uses lower-frequency pulses. The main advantage of the new approach, according to the release, is that patients don\u2019t feel an annoying tingling or buzzing sensation that\u2019s associated with the traditional approach. The release faithfully reports the outlines of the study in broad strokes and provides some of the outcomes in user-friendly terms. But there a lot of missing context that any reporter relying on the release should have been given. Notably, this was a company funded study run by investigators with close ties to the manufacturer of the device. The surgery required to implant the device can cause harms that weren\u2019t mentioned. Finally, it\u2019s not clear if this device is approved for use and if so, how much would it cost to have it implanted and would insurance cover that cost? Many people have chronic pain that isn\u2019t satisfactorily addressed with existing approaches. If a new device can improve on those existing therapies as is claimed in this release, many people would be interested to know about it. But along with offering the good news about potential benefits, release writers have an obligation to provide context that cuts the other way \u2014 whether that\u2019s possible harms from the device, conflicts of interest among the researchers, or limitations to the study design. They also owe it to readers to present a full array of potential alternatives. This release sets up what seems to be a false choice between SCS and either surgery or narcotics. Patient can also try yoga, exercise, NSAIDS, and behavioral modifications \u2014 treatments that can work and have little cost and risk.","label":"false"}

The study involved 10 individuals with a history of SIPE and 20 control subjects.

The release would be stronger if it had added some quantification of the benefits and relied less on a patient testimonial to make its case. A treatment for swimming-induced pulmonary edema likely won\u2019t matter to most of us recreational swimmers since the incidence of the condition seems low and confined to serious, competitive swimmers and divers.

{"claim_id":"11150","claim":"Genetic tests detect new way to fight war on breast cancer","explanation":"The story discusses new genetic tests that may help some women with early-stage breast cancer determine their risk of recurrence, and thus help with decisions about chemotherapy. More tailored (often less) chemotherapy is a newer idea for women who may not benefit as much from more aggressive treatment. A favorable score on a genetic test does not mean a woman at lower risk will not benefit at all from chemotherapy; she may, in fact, benefit some over the long term, but not as much as a woman with a higher chance of cancer recurring. Also, a woman's values and ability to live with a certain amount of risk, though small, is still part of the decision to have chemotherapy or forgo this treatment. The story presented no quantitative evidence for the Oncotype Dx test, which was the main focus of the story. It only said the test had been independently validated via a peer-reviewed process, and that it had been used on over 17,000 women. This test is validated only for women with node-negative breast cancer whose tumors are estrogen receptor-positive. The story does not mention that the test is time-sensitive and must be used within six months of diagnosis. The story emphasizes the cost of Oncotype Dx and notes that this may make it prohibitive for some women whose health insurance does not cover the test.

{"claim_id":"9622","claim":"Stem Cells May Safely Restore Motor Function In Patients Suffering From Disabilities After Stroke","explanation":"Drawn substantially from a feature-style news release issued by Stanford University\u2019s School of Medicine, this story\u00a0describes results of a trial in which modified human stem cells were injected into the brains of so-called \u201cchronic\u201d stroke patients. The results, which study authors called promising, showed the injections were safe. The stem cells\u2013as expected\u2013survived only briefly, but the researchers report that there were \u201cclinically meaningful results\u201d in which some patients (it\u2019s unclear how many) recovered \u201csignificant\u201d motor function. The story states the total number of patients (18), their age range (average age was 61), but it\u2019s missing hard information about the range of specific improvements, along with any interviews from researchers independent of this study or medical center. An estimated 800,000 people in the U.S. experience\u00a0an ischemic stroke each year, and most of them have permanent motor deficits unless treated with drugs within a few hours of the stroke. Given that this pilot safety study showed improvements in patients whose first-ever strokes occurred from six months to three years before treatment with mesenchymal stem cell injections, millions of people with stroke disability could potentially realize some restored function if the current research is borne out in further studies.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":"16001","claim":"We\u2019ve doubled the production of clean energy.","explanation":"Obama said, \"we\u2019ve doubled the production of clean energy.\" The White House said he was referring to wind, solar and geothermal, which are three types of renewable resources promoted in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Energy Information Administration confirmed that capacity had basically doubled between 2009 and 2012, accomplishing Obama\u2019s goals. Renewable resource advocates also agreed that the Recovery Act contributed to that growth. Obama didn\u2019t mention, however, that so-called \"clean energy\" still accounts for a sliver of U.S. energy production, which overwhelmingly relies on fossil fuels. Nor does it include other kinds of renewable energy, such as biomass and hydroelectric, which have remained relatively flat.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"16469","claim":"Of the 98 top oxycodone-dispensing doctors who used to live in Florida, \"today, there are none.","explanation":"Bondi said that of the top 100 oxycodone-dispensing doctors, 98 were\u00a0in Florida, and\u00a0\"today, there are none.\" She cited DEA numbers that since 2010, the number of physicians who dispensed the most oxycodone in the nation and also lived in Florida had dropped from 98 of the top 100 to zero. The DEA told us there are a few problems with that stat. First, it was for the biggest purchasers of oxycodone, not dispensers -- the DEA said the list\u00a0didn't\u00a0track dispensation. Second, the number in 2010 was 90 and not 98, although the 98 figure was widely reported by the state and the media in the past few years. Third, in 2014 there was one top 100 oxycodone purchaser in Florida, a buyer for a cruise ship fleet. The DEA data only tracks top purchasers, not whether actual drug use decreased, but other sources confirmed oxycodone abuse is on a downward trend in the state, although there\u2019s debate over whether a 2011 law Bondi supported is the sole factor. While the specifics are a bit off, the gist and context of what Bondi is saying is accurate: There are no more Florida pill mill doctors in the DEA\u2019s top 100.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"9688","claim":"School water coolers may help kids lose weight","explanation":"Despite it being a fairly short report, CBS covers a lot of ground: it quantifies the benefits in absolute terms, outlines the study design and weighs the advantages of modern water dispensers against \u201cold-fashioned\u201d water fountains. But in other areas, the story falls short. There is no mention of costs and of study limitations. Although it quotes from the accompanying JAMA Pediatrics editorial, the CBS story doesn\u2019t feature any critical perspectives on the study. We would have liked a closer look at some of the study\u2019s shortcomings, which could have been achieved by comments from an independent source, or someone who was not involved in the study. More context on where this study fits in \u201cthe growing body of evidence\u201d would have also been welcome. Finally, word choice could have been better. CBS refers to the JAMA editorial and writes that \u201cthe study\u2019s findings are significant.\u201d However, \u201cstatistically significant\u201d has a different meaning than what the public believes is \u201csignificant.\u201d The distinction should be clear, or another word should be used. Childhood obesity is a health concern that is on the minds of many parents and policymakers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. In 2012, more than one third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese, the CDC said. And compared to other countries around the world, the US comes out on top when it comes to obesity among adults, according to a 2014 OECD report. There are even speculations that high obesity rates may cause life expectancy in the US to decline. Therefore, any efforts to curb the \u201cobesity epidemic\u201d in America is newsworthy, especially if the intervention is low cost, low risk and for children.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"9066","claim":"Landmark study may impact standard stroke treatment guidelines","explanation":"This news release from Emory University describes  findings of a randomized clinical trial that showed  positive outcomes among almost half of stroke patients whose brain blood clots were removed well outside the time frame of six hours currently recommended by stroke experts. The release properly discloses that the study was funded by a company that makes the clot removing device and quotes investigators from one of the participant investigators not at Emory. The release could have been stronger had it disclosed details about the patients (such as age, and their co-occurring conditions, race, gender); the size of the population of stroke victims in the U.S. likely to benefit from \u201clate\u201d clot removal; and limitations of the study (e.g. follow up was for 90 days, not long term). Some details on which stroke victims are considered eligible for clot removal within six to 24 hours and the costs of the clot removal procedure itself would have been helpful. Disability from stroke is a major cause of suffering and high health care costs in the United States and elsewhere, and despite advances in technology (clot removal devices) and clot-busting drugs, its prevention has long depended on how fast a stroke patient can make it to a hospital for treatment. The six-hour window long thought to be the maximum time in which clot removal technologies could save brains and lives has meant that individuals unlucky enough to have a stroke in remote locations, or in bad weather, for example, stood little chance of enough recovery to lead independent lives. Thus, the results of rigorous studies like the one described in the release \u2014 it was stopped early because of the positive outcomes \u2014 are exceptionally newsworthy, and important for the public to know about.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"10900","claim":"Botox may prevent irregular heartbeat after bypass surgery","explanation":"This concise (393 word) news release from the American Heart Association on a trial that used botulinum toxin to prevent irregular heart rhythms after bypass surgery packs a lot of good information into a small frame. The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment.","label":"true"}

Canova omits that two days later she changed her vote, but the vote had no practical effect and the measure passed anyway. Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when she voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didn\u2019t contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry. The farm bill is a sweeping bill that benefits a long list of programs -- not just sugar. Wasserman Schultz has taken other steps to support Everglades cleanup.

While it states that this therapeutic approach is as good as, or perhaps better, than a drug (gabapentin) often prescribed for hot flashes, the release offers no data showing the extent of improvement, nor are there mentions of the cost of such treatments, or of potential harms from using it which, while not enormous, are not negligible either. The release also neglects to identify any of the researchers involved in the trial. More and more people are surviving breast cancer and there is increasing interest among survivors and clinicians about quality of life for survivors. As the release states, perhaps 6 million patients may have survived by the year 2020, meaning even serious discomforts like hot flashes among such patients will become a growing problem.

But blasphemy laws remain on the books in Muslim nations, and the largest international body that speaks for those nations has said plainly that such laws are appropriate and ought to be adopted in the west. Not even Turley argues that this is the result the administration wanted, and another critic of the administration's strategy said American diplomats do not support efforts to establish an international blasphemy standard. One could argue that by participating in the ongoing negotiations, the administration has de facto endorsed a vehicle for the Muslim nations, but that is not the same as supporting their efforts.

{"claim_id":"9353","claim":"Which antidepressant is right for you? This genetic test could help","explanation":"This Philadelphia Inquirer article looks at two companies\u2019 direct-to-consumer genetic tests designed to help doctors rely less on trial-and-error, and more on genetic markers, in guiding their medication choices for patients who\u2019ve proven difficult to treat for depression. The article offers balance through two patient anecdotes. One patient says the genetic testing helped guide her to an effective antidepressant, while the other isn\u2019t convinced. An outside expert is also tapped who points to specific treatments rather than genetic testing for higher chances of success. Although this article was cautious about the touted benefits, it would have served readers better by exploring some of the limitations of the research studies. The evidence doesn\u2019t appear to come from gold-standard, randomized controlled trials. The only study we found through an online search was an abstract presented at a May 2018 medical conference. The majority of patients with major depression who choose antidepressant therapy do not achieve remission with the first medication they try. Even among those who do, many relapse. That\u2019s why many patients end up frustrated \u2014 and still suffering with symptoms \u2014 as they endure a subsequent trial-and-error approach until an effective medication or combination of medications is found. One promise of precision medicine \u2014 that has yet to be proven \u2014 is that genetic testing may help guide this process and make it more \u201cpersonalized\u201d and efficient. It\u2019s important to make it clear (as this article does) that these genetic tests cannot predict which medicines will work, and it\u2019s arguable if they can even identify those that will not. Furthermore, because the financial stakes are high, it\u2019s important for journalists to scrutinize (and be transparent) about the funding of studies on these genetic tests, potential conflicts of interest, and whether the results are expressed in more meaningful absolute terms, rather than more eye-catching (and potentially misleading) relative terms.

{"claim_id":"10329","claim":"Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis symptoms curbed by bariatric surgery","explanation":"This is a chart review study which shows that losing excess weight\u00a0by undergoing\u00a0bariatric surgery could lessen the pain and inflammation experienced by\u00a0psoriasis sufferers. While the treatment sounds hopeful, important information about the other (overall) benefits of bariatric surgery, its risks, alternatives and costs, including costs of treating complications, were\u00a0all missing from this news release. This news release comes from a poster presented at a national meeting, which has not yet undergone peer review. Many key elements were not well described or sufficiently highlighted. The fact that this research comes from observational data (chart review) is important since we cannot infer causation from this type of research, and it is possible that some other factor stemming from the surgery besides the weight loss (for example, changes in diet or absorption of key nutrients) was responsible for the remission in psoriasis symptoms, rather than the weight loss itself. Psoriasis affects millions of\u00a0Americans, and many people\u00a0with moderate to severe psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis in their lifetimes. If obesity contributes to the development of this painful condition, then weight loss methods such as bariatric surgery may reduce those symptoms. Psoriasis sufferers may have few options to treat what is a lifetime of inflammation and pain, so if safe and effective methods to reduce those symptoms are available, many people could benefit. However, it needs to be pointed out that bariatric surgery is indicated only for morbid obesity, and it is not clear whether other weight loss therapies would result in the same benefit.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"10509","claim":"Drug trial success a boost for Arena","explanation":"This was a story about a possible new medication in the pipeline that may enable people to lose weight. It did not include the information needed to understand the relative strength of the study reported about and did not quantify in absolute terms (number of pounds lost)\u00a0 the benefit that might be attained with the use of this medication. It was an interesting piece in that it made an attempt to contrast this medication with one that was withdrawn from the market. However, in light of this comparison, the story should have explained something about the time frame of the current study, and how that compared with the period of time that was needed for the problems with the drug that was withdrawn from the market to be observed. It should have also mentioned that the current trials with the new medication specifically exclude people with type of heart issue that was seen to be problematic with the withdrawn drug. The bottom line is that while the company may be optimistic that this drug will not result in harms, there are not yet sufficient data available to determine whether this is the case. It would have been useful to readers had the story made this clear. Finally, this was a San Diego paper reporting on \u201cmid-stage\u201d trial results on a San Diego company\u2019s product. It is doubtful that the paper would report on such results from another company in another location. Applying that \u201cbusiness news\u201d approach to health care product news is often problematic.

{"claim_id":"10481","claim":"$300 to learn risk of prostate cancer","explanation":"On the whole, this is a well crafted story about a new genetic test that may provide men with advance knowledge about their potential to develop prostate cancer in the future. The story made it very clear that gaining this information is not without cost above and beyond the test. This new screen suffers from the same problem as the currently available methods of detecting prostate cancer, namely determining whether the cancer will be deadly or not. This is a critical piece of information because as the story points out \u2013 the treatments for prostate cancer are not without side effect. It will fall upon the men taking this test who have an indication of high risk to then make a determination of the course of action they want to pursue. It is important for them to recognize that at this point in time, we do not yet know whether aggressive treatment of early detected prostate cancer is effective. The story allowed the test\u2019s promoters to have their say. But it offered good context and balance, particularly with the quote about the impact on a man\u2019s decision-making, which is key:\u00a0 \u201cTechnology today enables us to find out a huge amount of information,\u201d Dr. Gelmann said. \u201cBut how does the public deal with this information?

{"claim_id":"11071","claim":"Antidepressants relieve hot flashes","explanation":"While the benefits are clearly explained, the story failed to mention any possible harms,\u00a0didn\u2019t discuss the cost of the drug, and didn\u2019t\u00a0explain that there is uncertainty about how long the benefits may last. The story also didn\u2019t put the results in context with hormone replacement, the main alternative for women with more bothersome symptoms. These deficits might have been addressed in comments from an independent expert, but the story didn\u2019t seek out any\u00a0external\u00a0perspective on the findings. We need more treatment options for women with\u00a0disruptive menopausal symptoms. Although hormone treatment is effective, many women are reluctant to take hormones because of the small\u00a0increase in potentially serious adverse effects associated with their use. Emerging research suggests that antidepressants\u00a0may be an alternate option, but the study discussed in this story found that\u00a0Lexapro is only slightly more effective than a placebo for reducing hot flashes. In addition, use of antidepressants also may cause a variety of adverse effects which, while less serious than the risks\u00a0of hormone therapy, can be troublesome\u00a0enough to cause\u00a0people to stop\u00a0taking the\u00a0medication.

{"claim_id":"9000","claim":"UTA researcher patents \u201croach motel\u201d for cancer","explanation":"This news release announces the European patent for a medical device that is designed to attract, trap and kill cancer cells. Ostensibly, the device could be used to detect early signs of metastasis in various forms of cancer, and potentially could find use in cancer treatment. However, the device\u2019s utility at this point appears to be largely hypothetical. The release indicates that no clinical trials have been done; offers no information on benefits (or health risks) associated with such a device; and says nothing about the potential costs associated with such a device. Indeed, the release does not tell readers anything about the research that underlies the device. Based on the information in the release, the device appears to be \u2014 at this point \u2014 little more than a concept. As the National Cancer Institute notes, \u201cCancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world.\u201d Indeed, cancers claim the lives of hundreds of thousands of people each year in the United States alone. With that in mind, it is important to be cautious when announcing a new tool that \u201ccan be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.\u201d To be more specific, one should at the very least be prepared to provide meaningful information to support the claim. Securing a patent may be valuable \u2014 both financially and for the public good \u2014 but that value can only be realized if the relevant technology can be used in a clinical setting.

The NBC coverage was focused on a cost-effectiveness study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A competing story in the New York Times brought in another study, also focused on the new statin guidelines, and used the occasion to do something that this story didn\u2019t quite accomplish: provide a detailed explanation of the quality of the evidence supporting wider statin use. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the USA.

{"claim_id":"8945","claim":"Can't exercise?

A hot bath may help improve inflammation, metabolism, study suggest\u2019 Sub-head: \u2018Hot-water immersion improved inflammatory markers and blood sugar in overweight men\u2019 The subheading is a fairly good summary of the study. But the \u201cCan\u2019t exercise? \u2026\u201d headline promises much more than this small study\u00a0can support. The research question? How does hot water immersion \u2014\u00a0 that is, ten 1-hour soaks at 102\u00baF over two weeks\u00a0 \u2014 affect metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in the blood of 10 overweight and sedentary men. The answer? Some mild, transient changes were noted that could theoretically be beneficial. Just because exercise has been shown to transiently increase inflammatory markers and decrease blood sugar, and hot water immersion does the same thing, doesn\u2019t mean that the latter might substitute for the former. Furthermore, the research into the relationship between inflammation and sugar\/insulin levels is mostly in rodents, and extrapolating these benefits to humans is unrealistic. Yes, exercise can temporarily trigger an anti-inflammatory response at the molecular level,\u00a0as well as decrease sugar\/insulin levels. This study suggests repeated, lengthy hot water immersion\u00a0can do the same thing in 10 overweight men. But that hardly means the two interventions are comparable in any way, or that these blood changes have any meaningful or sustainable clinical benefits.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"8950","claim":"Distinguishing fatal prostate cancer from 'manageable' cancer now possible","explanation":"A news release from the University of York describes a new test that uses computer algorithms and genetic markers to distinguish between aggressive and more manageable types of prostate cancer. While the study is informative, the news release summarizes it in confusing terms and analogies that may be difficult for a lay reader to understand. Furthermore, it neglects to mention until the very end of the release that this test has only been done in the laboratory, and is likely still years away from being available to actual patients. Prostate cancer is relatively common. According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lives. It is also the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Some prostate cancers are more aggressive than others, however. A test that could distinguish between aggressive and more manageable cancer types could help some patients avoid unnecessary and risky radiotherapy and surgery. An estimated 40% of prostate cancers detected by the standard PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test are considered over-diagnosed. For decades, the great majority of these men were aggressively over-treated with surgery or radiation. In recent years, more men with low-risk cancers are opting for active surveillance, a monitoring strategy that involves repeated PSA tests and biopsies. Only men with evidence of cancer progression will be offered curative treatment. However, the current methods for determining low-risk status \u2014 PSA and Gleason score \u2014 are considered relatively crude. A more accurate test would not only help limit over treatment but would potentially give men more confidence in selecting active surveillance.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"11138","claim":"Study Results Published in JAMA Conclude that 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 Exams Outperform Conventional Mammography for Women with Both Dense and Nondense Breasts","explanation":"This news release describes the results of a large population-based study comparing several screening outcomes (including recall rates and\u00a0 cancer detection rates) between digital mammography and digital mammography plus tomosynthesis (i.e., Hologic Genius 3D mammography). Although the published study did find a significant difference between the two screening modalities by breast density tissue, the rates were not significant in women with extremely dense breasts. A point the news release failed to mention. Another caveat is that the original research did not look at healthcare savings or any clinical outcomes. But the manufacturers of the 3D mammography tout the the potential savings and improved outcomes in the news release, suggesting to readers that these outcomes are to be expected when their technology is used. Better detection of breast cancer through newer technology is not the same as improving clinical outcomes. Failing to mention that women with extremely dense breasts did not benefit from the newer technology can lead to more confusion for women who may falsely assume the new technology will help them. This release also catches a coat-ride on new legislation adopted by about half of U.S. states that require that women receive notifications of their breast density (BRN) along with their screening mammogram results. These mandated notifications on breast density are not well-regarded by a number of experts since their value to patients is questionable.

For patients with high blood pressure, there are numerous studies that demonstrate medications to lower blood pressure are associated with decreased rates of heart attacks, strokes and to a lesser extent, kidney failure. Given the number of different choices available from a range of classes of medications, how do patients and doctors decide on which to use? Here the comparison is between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). When considering which agent to use for a given patient, a physician generally considers the relative benefits, harms and costs of the different agents, as well as any patient factors that may lead one class of agents to have particular advantages or limitations (for example, if the patient already has a high potassium level, use of either an ACEI or ARB may be problematic since they both raise potassium levels further). The current study seeks to address mainly the relative benefits of these two classes of medicines and glosses over harms and costs while not even mentioning patient-level factors. In terms of the benefits, the authors suggest that initial studies comparing ACEIs and ARBs were biased by the times in which the original studies used to justify approval were performed. Specifically, the older ACEIs studies came at a time when lifestyle and other medication options were more limited than the following decades when ARBs were studied. It is difficult to confirm or refute this assumption, but studies of these classes in a more comparable time frame would decrease bias associated with temporal trends. The current study adds evidence that these two classes are similar, but this isn\u2019t really dramatically new information. Indeed, many guidelines suggest ACEIs or ARBs as being equivalent. The advantage of ARBs is better tolerability, as mentioned in this article, but the disadvantage remains cost. Though the article provides one line saying that with more generics available for ARBs, the cost difference has diminished, but even the cost of generics appear higher for ARBs than ACEIs. Thus, for many clinicians even an increased\u00a0recognition of similar benefits may not lead to much change in practice given differences in costs","label":"true"}

Post-surgical infections can cause pain, poor wound healing, and severe problems including death, research has showed. The release noted they\u2019re the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-$10 billion annually. While smartphone apps might improve the ability of staff to monitor surgical wounds, news releases should point out the need to invest in a support structure \u2014 such as staff to train patients and monitor data \u2014 and should refrain from stating benefits that haven\u2019t been demonstrated.","label":"MISLEADING"}

There was plenty to like about this story,\u00a0including comments from two excellent independent sources which added valuable context to the piece. The story also makes the very important point that this study looked only at a surrogate marker of heart disease risk, LDL cholesterol, and not actual heart disease outcomes. But\u00a0the story didn\u2019t provide crucial information about\u00a0costs or availability of the diet components and it didn\u2019t fairly\u00a0describe\u00a0how\u00a0difficult it would be\u00a0for most\u00a0people to maintain this kind of diet.

However, it fails to explain a few things about the vaccine and its target, such as how many women are infected with the cancer-causing HPV strains, how many women develop cervical cancer, and perhaps most importantly, what researchers know about how well this new vaccine works to prevent cancer or precancerous changes in the cervix. Hearing more about this from an independent expert, rather than from two Merck representatives, would have provided some balance.

It claims a 27 percent relative risk reduction among predisposed infants who were breastfed compared to those who weren\u2019t, but we have no other data points, no absolute risk reduction information. The release doesn\u2019t provide enough information for readers to be assured that other factors\u00a0did not play a\u00a0role in the results. Reviewers (and presumably other interested readers) were unable to access the actual research paper, or an abstract online, at the time of the review. [Editor\u2019s note. Several days after reaching out to the issuing organization, an abstract on the study was provided, but it did not change the outcome of the review.] The relationship between genetic variance and environmental factors in the eventual development of asthma is not crystal clear. Asthma appears to have a strong genetic predisposition. A child with a parent with asthma is three-to-six times more likely to develop asthma than other children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If breastfeeding infants predisposed to asthma could actually reduce their risk of respiratory symptoms by a quarter or more, then that would be a substantial improvement, both to individual and to public health, especially given the growing proportion of children developing asthma and other respiratory problems.","label":"false"}

It may help readers to see that statin use is a choice and that consumers should understand both the benefits and potential harms that may be associated with whatever pills they decide to take.

{"claim_id":"9193","claim":"The best treatment for laryngeal cancer? This approach helps decide","explanation":"The release focuses on recent research published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology \u2013 Head and Neck Surgery. The research assessed the effectiveness of a treatment technique for laryngeal cancer that exposed patients with advanced (stage 3 or 4) cancer to a one-time chemotherapy treatment that, theoretically, would allow physicians to determine whether patients were responding well to chemotherapy. The idea was that patients who responded well could be treated with chemotherapy and radiation, whereas patients who did not respond well would have surgery to remove the voice box immediately, rather than trying chemotherapy and radiation first. The goal was to improve the five-year survival rate of patients. The researchers reported that this technique \u2014 called \u201cinduction chemotherapy\u201d \u2014 was effective, leading to 79 percent survival rates for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer \u2014 which is markedly better than the 66 percent survival rate for those patients who did not receive induction chemotherapy. The release does a nice job describing the historical context of these therapies, how available the techniques are and how the study was conducted, with one exception. The release doesn\u2019t mention that this was a retrospective, observational study, not a clinical trial, which is an important limitation. Correlation does not equal causation.

Our voices are part of who we are and how we connect with others. What\u2019s more, being able to talk can be a key part of professional life for everyone from teachers and salespeople to reporters and, well, doctors. For that reason, many patients dealing with laryngeal cancer want to do whatever can be done to spare their larynx, or voice box, from surgery. If new techniques can help patients make more informed decisions about the trade-off between survival rate and laryngeal surgery, that\u2019s important news for patients and medical personnel. The release does a fair job of addressing the new findings responsibly. It stresses that there are many options and no one-size-fits-all treatment.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"11154","claim":"Prostate Cancer Drug Gets Lukewarm Review","explanation":"This story reports on an analysis done for the agency that oversees Medicare of the evidence of the effects of Provenge (sipuleucel-T) in certain men with advanced prostate cancer. It summarizes some of the conclusions and includes comments about how the analysis might influence a decision about whether Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the expensive new treatment. But the story leaves readers with the impression that the drug has been proven to extend the life of the average patient by about four months when actually there are many uncertainties about that estimate due to weaknesses in the clinical trials sponsored by the maker of the Provenge. The assessment done for Medicare underscores the questions that still need to be answered in order for doctors and patients to know whether and how to use Provenge, but that perspective is largely missing from this story. This story portrays debates about insurance coverage of Provenge as a matter of how much value to place on four months of life. But what the federal analysis of the Provenge trials actually focuses on is uncertainty about the amount of additional survival and questions about how other factors besides Provenge (including other treatments that were given to the trial participants) might have affected the trial results. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer occurring in men, though most tumors grow slowly and men diagnosed with the disease typically die of something other than their prostate cancer. Some tumors are aggressive and more effective treatments are needed for these cases. Provenge\u2019s novel immunotherapy approach offers an attractive alternative to existing treatments, but the initial application for FDA approval was rejected in 2007. A new clinical trial was done and the treatment was approved for sale in the U.S. earlier this year. Although historically Medicare and Medicaid have covered treatments deemed safe and effective without considering the magnitude of the expected benefit, the limited additional survival and the high cost of Provenge treatment have highlighted debates about whether and how to consider these factors in deciding whether a particular treatment should be reimbursed.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":"10804","claim":"Baby aspirin linked to reduced cancer deaths","explanation":"This story about the apparent cancer reducing effect of daily low-dose aspirin seen in an analysis of data from a collection of earlier heart disease trials provides a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the latest study and its methods than some of the other stories we reviewed. It also provides more specific information about harms that aspirin can cause and it includes several independent voices that add valuable perspective. As a result, readers\u00a0will be more likely than those who saw some of the other coverage to understand the call for thoughtful consideration before initiating\u00a0a daily aspirin regimen in hopes of reaping cancer reduction benefits. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease, and there are few proven methods for reducing one\u2019s risk of developing the disease. The study discussed in this story provides fairly convincing evidence that a daily low-dose aspirin does indeed prevent some cancers when taken over the course of many years. Because of limitations in the data, however, it is unclear if these benefits will apply to\u00a0all healthy adults or if they outweigh the risk of side effects, which can include potentially fatal bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and brain. Individuals need to take these uncertainties into account when\u00a0deciding whether they want to commit to taking aspirin\u00a0every day for many years.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"11550","claim":"Reverse your diabetes -- and you can stay diabetes-free long-term","explanation":"This release from Newcastle University describes a very small study that sought to control type 2 diabetes in patients through a reduced-calorie diet and a weight-management program. The results showed that 12 of the 30 participants saw a resumption of normal insulin production that continued for six months, supporting the release\u2019s claim of \u201creversing\u201d the disease. But what about the other 18 patients? A study this small can hardly suggest its finding are applicable to all type 2 diabetes patients which, in effect, it does. And benefits observed after only 6 months may not be maintained over the longer term. The release also omitted discussion of harms and alternatives, and didn\u2019t give us a good picture of how the study was conducted. Rates of Type 2 diabetes have increased markedly in parallel with rates of obesity, especially in developed countries. It has long been recognized that diet, weight loss and exercise can improve the control of diabetes. Large studies investigating the impact of weight loss surgery have demonstrated that blood sugar results can return to normal after significant weight loss. It has also been shown that individuals who regain weight after surgery can then have blood sugars go up again and need to resume medications for diabetes. Patients and their families may excitedly assume that the approach described in this release is right for them and alter their normal regimen in the treatment of their disease. But adhering to the diet discussed in this release will be very difficult for most people and is not without risks. And despite the release\u2019s suggestion of universal benefit, a \u201creversal\u201d of diabetes did not occur in the majority of patients.

{"claim_id":"9015","claim":"Allina study shows patients with very small breast tumors may forgo lymph node biopsies","explanation":"The news release highlights a study \u2014 that joins about a dozen similar such studies over the past decade \u2014 trying to determine if looking for cancer spread in axillary (armpit) lymph nodes is worthwhile in a specific subtype of breast cancer called \u201cmicroinvasive,\u201d or \u201cTmic\u201d (which refers to a tumor 1 millimeter or smaller). It remains a controversial surgical dilemma, in part, because some studies have found evidence of microinvasive cancer spreading to the lymph nodes 12.5% of the time, while this study, in particular, found the lowest incidence \u2014 just 1.5%. The authors conclude that, based on their findings, they believe microinvasive cancer is akin to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in that spread to the lymph nodes is rare. The researchers conclude from the study that routine node sampling in microinvasive cancer is of questionable benefit. The news release is very succinct in describing the findings of this small (under 300 patients) single-center study. Readers need more information before they can fairly weigh the researchers\u2019 recommendation. For example, the release only notes that spread to the lymph nodes was found in patients with \u201crelatively large\u201d examples of DCIS, without clarifying what \u201cfairly large\u201d means; doesn\u2019t note the average followup period for study participants, or what the outcomes were at the end of the study such as breast cancer recurrence, distant metastatic disease, or death from breast cancer. The release also does not mention if other tumor factors, such as hormone receptor status, were associated with spread to the lymph nodes. Recent advances in mammography and an increase in screening mean more breast abnormalities are detected; however, whether they should be labeled or treated as cancer is not always clear. Removal of some of the underarm lymph nodes (sentinel node biopsy) is generally performed at the time of surgery for early stage breast cancer in order to confirm whether or not there has been spread, and to inform treatment decisions. It is often not performed at the time of breast conserving lumpectomy in cases of DCIS; however, the decision whether\u00a0to not to perform\u00a0sentinel node biopsy in cases of microinvasive breast cancer is controversial. Breast cancer is staged according to tumor size (denoted as \u201cT\u201d) and lymph node spread (denoted as \u201cN\u201d). The \u201cT\u201d category ranges from 0-4 based on\u00a0the size of the tumor in the breast. Tis represents ductal carcinoma in-situ, and T1 tumors are invasive breast cancers smaller than 2cm. Tmic is the designation used for microinvasive cancers \u2014 where the invasive\u00a0component is less than 1mm. Future research in this area will help clarify whether Tmic should be approached more like DCIS or like an invasive cancer. Less treatment would have huge implications for surgeons, health care costs, and especially the quality of life for many patients.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The recent birth of octoplets in the US has very dramatically raised awareness of the risk associated with multiple births and the variability in how IVF is performed, even with the existence of guidelines. This story reports on a newer procedure, elective single-embryo transfer (eSET), in which only one embryo is implanted at a time. This procedure eliminates the risk of multiple births while appearing to have favorable pregnancy rates. The story did a good job describing the costs, and alternatives. It adequately quantifies the pregnancy rate and multiple birth rate in women who get eSET and standard IVF. It quotes multiple sources who provide valuable perspective. The story could have been improved by describing the availability of eSET. Clearly IVF is available, but it is not clear if elective single-embryo transfer (eSET) is widely available. Furthermore, the story could have provided more information on the evidence to support eSET. Although the story mentions a recent study, it does not describe whether this study provides strong evidence to support the procedure or not. Finally, the story should have clarified that eSET is not a new method but rather a name for the active choice to transfer a single embryo in a women who could have been eligible for transfer of more than one. Elective single-embryo transfer is theoretically available to all women at facilities that provide embryo transfer at the stage of development known as the blastocyst stage. Readers may have benefitted from knowing the option can be discussed with any infertility care team.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":"18016","claim":"Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years.","explanation":"Steve Goreham said \"Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years.\" The databases we checked generally show small increases during that period, but not enough to be statistically significant, thanks to a short timeframe and a starting point that included an unusually warm year in 1998. That's why, at the same time, NOAA data clearly show that global temperatures in 15 of the last 16 years have been the hottest recorded. So Goreham is correct that the temperature trend has been flat, but it's flat at record highs. Because his statement reflects cherry-picked numbers and leaves out important details that would give a very different impression.

{"claim_id":"10797","claim":"Sit back and relax to brain wave music","explanation":"The story describes a procedure to turn brain waves into music, which reportedly can help various medical conditions, although the evidence for this is lacking. Importantly, there seems to be little, if any, evidence that this treatment is helpful for the conditions mentioned, e.g. depression, anxiety, pain syndromes. Yet the story treats the \"treatment\" as if it has a proven benefit. It's also unclear what the benefit might be or for how long. Unfortunately, NBC's physician-reporter, who was apparently supposed to objectively comment on this \"therapy,\" only gushes at what the treatment might do, despite a lack of compelling evidence that it does anything. While this provides for good TV banter, it doesn't provide an objective source for the story. Despite all the airtime given this, NBC relied on only one source \u2013\u00a0 \"a neuropsychiatrist (who) brought brain music therapy to the U.S. from Moscow, and claims it cures all kinds of ills.\" The story also doesn't describe any harms from this procedure, its availability, or what other treatment options\u2013proven treatment options\u2013might exist for any of the conditions discussed. It seems to represent this procedure as a \"treatment\" for all psychiatric illness, fatigue, or stress, which is a disservice to the public. In an era in which many are pushing for evidence-based medical reporting, this story goes in the opposite direction.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"9453","claim":"In a First, Gene Therapy Halts a Fatal Brain Disease","explanation":"This story is one of two that we are reviewing (the other is from the Associated Press) that focuses on a recent paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. At issue is a novel gene therapy used to limit or eliminate symptoms related to the disease adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The New York Times story does a good job of describing everything that led up to the study, does a fair job of describing the study itself (and its results), and highlights the potential price tag of this treatment. However, the story doesn\u2019t make clear how far this treatment is removed from widespread clinical use or the outstanding questions that remain about the treatment \u2014 such as the fact that we don\u2019t know if the benefits are temporary. Left untreated, ALD often leads to death within 1-10 years of diagnosis. And there are precious few treatment options available. What\u2019s more, the primary treatment, bone marrow transplantation, relies on the availability of a donor \u2014 and poses significant health risks of its own. All this makes new treatment options incredibly important for ALD patients and their loved ones. However, the fact that we are talking about the life and well-being of patients \u2014 usually children \u2014 also makes it incredibly important to place the work in context. Limitations, availability and unanswered questions are always key points worth making, and especially so when many parents are eager for information about something that may affect the health and well-being of their children.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"17291","claim":"We have invested record funding in protecting our environment.","explanation":"During his State of the State speech Scott said, \"We have invested record funding in protecting our environment.\" After the speech, a Scott spokesman said he was referring to money directed toward springs restoration. Scott\u2019s statement during the speech likely left \u00a0listeners with the impression that his investment in the environment in general is a record, and that would be misleading. Sorting out the total investment in environmental protection under Scott compared to predecessors is complicated because funding comes from state and federal sources and multiple state programs relate to the environment. However, under one way to compare funding - - the total for the Department of Environmental Protection -- Scott falls far short of Bush\u2019s record.

{"claim_id":"9122","claim":"Anti-gravity treadmills get patients running again after knee surgery","explanation":"Researchers in the UK presented a single case study of a 39-year-old runner who had surgery on her knee followed by physical therapy using a special treadmill. The release claimed the \u201canti-gravity\u201d treadmill, which reduces the pressure of weight on the knee, helped this patient\u00a0reduce fears about re-injury and increase their confidence in their ability to run again. The release did not provide any data to support that claim. The release would have been stronger had it included a mention of the cost and availability of anti-gravity treadmills. They\u2019re very expensive pieces of equipment but are becoming more widely available through rehabilitation clinics. Knee pain is a very common condition and often keeps people from activities, including exercise, that are known to promote overall health. This news release about a single patient\u2019s recovery from surgery overstates the benefit of the \u201canti-gravity\u201d treadmill by implying that because this patient recovered better after using the machine, that others might, too. Studying a single patient, without comparison to a control group, cannot prove this treadmill improves outcomes. As we\u2019ve said in a recent blog post, case studies should not be used as proof of health outcomes.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":"11414","claim":"Avastin Largely Safe for Patients With Type of Advanced Lung Cancer","explanation":"This is a story reporting on a study which reported on the potential harms associated with the addition of the drug Avastin in patients with an advanced form of a specific type of lung cancer. What the study showed and was reported in this story was that there were several individuals who experienced bleeding complications with Avastin added to their treatment. The piece fails to indicate what benefit patients might hope to expect from the addition of this drug to their other treatment regimens. Although the story was clear about the potential harms associated with this drug, it seems a little odd not to more fully explain that it is not yet known whether the drug will be helpful to patients with metastatic non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer \u2013 especially since the FDA announced this week that this drug does not demonstrate benefit when used to treat breast cancer. In the absence of information about the benefits, it is not possible to weigh the risk of harm against the potential for benefit. This is an issue that should have been addressed in this story. The timing of this story is curious but probably coincidental \u2013 to a degree. The big news about the drug Avastin is that the FDA has decided not to approve it for use in treating breast cancer because it does not improve survival or delay disease progression. While this did receive one line in the story, instead of hyping the potential for use of this particular in lung cancer, the space might have better used to examine what are the expectations for a drug used to treat a metastatic cancer. Drugs need to be not only safe, but also affective in order to add value to a treatment regimen. So while we know the story was based on a journal article released this week, it is the editorial decision to report on this rather mixed bag finding that is curious. And while we applaud news coverage of Phase 4 trials, are all Phase 4 trials (or the relative paucity of same?) going to be reported consistently?","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9167","claim":"Allergan Reports Topline Phase II Data Supporting Advancement of BOTOX\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxinA) for the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)","explanation":"This news release from Allergan reports results of a phase II clinical trial of botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) as a treatment for major depressive disorder. The study compared effectiveness of two different dosages of botox with placebo in women for up to 24 weeks of treatment. The release states that the 30-unit\u00a0dose was superior to the placebo at three and nine weeks, but not at six weeks. The 50-unit dose was not superior to placebo. The heading claims\u00a0that the results support advancement of botox into larger phase lll trials, but further into the release we learn there was no statistically significant difference between treatment and placebo at the predetermined goal of six weeks. Additionally, the lower dose arm of the study\u00a0outperformed the higher dose. As written, the heading and some introductory material are misleading. With mental health concerns more and more in the spotlight of health policy in the United States, an effective treatment for depression would be important news. Current treatments for depression help about two-thirds of those with significant depression symptoms. A treatment with a different mechanism of action such as botox to help some treatment resistant patients would be a welcome addition to the therapeutic toolbox. However, this news release obscures the study results. Botox has already been promoted for \u201coff label\u201d use to treat depression for some time.

{"claim_id":"8972","claim":"Innovative triple pill significantly lowers blood pressure, study finds","explanation":"This news release does a nice job of explaining the basic design of a study investigating whether a once-daily \u201ctriple pill\u201d (that combines 3 different blood pressure-lowering medications) is more effective in lowering blood pressure than doctors\u2019 usual approach. But there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement here including: presenting the findings in a more meaningful context for patients, including the substantial adverse outcomes noted by the researchers, and using much more toned down language for results that are neither novel or all that significant. Notably, there is a significant financial conflict of interest involving the authors. This should have been made clear to readers. The global importance of poorly controlled high blood pressure is well-stated by the authors in the introduction to their study published in JAMA (paraphrased): High blood pressure is the leading cause of mortality and cardiovascular disease globally with most of the disease burden occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The availability and affordability of medications is a critical issue. About one-third of individuals with high blood pressure in these settings receive treatment. Only about half of patients treated in high-income countries and about 1-in-4 patients in low- and middle-income countries achieve blood pressure control. A fixed low-dose combination therapy with inexpensive blood pressure-lowering drugs has the potential to address several barriers to improve blood pressure control worldwide. Indeed, there\u2019s significant need for a simple-to-take, effective, and affordable medication to address this issue. If successful, the benefits to patients, and the profits for developers, would be massive.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"9222","claim":"Immunotherapy shows promise in preventing leukemia relapse","explanation":"This release about a small trial of immunotherapy applied to a dozen leukemia patients who are at unusually high risk of relapse leaps to premature interpretations and inflates the meaning of the results far beyond the limited guidance for future research that this sort of study can offer. It inappropriately elevates the importance of relapse rates, implying that they predict vital outcomes, such as survival or quality life improvements, which this trial did not measure. Even as it puffs up the potential benefits, the release neglects to note either the short-term harms reported by researchers in their scientific conference abstract or the potential life-threatening harms that immunotherapy may expose patients to. The release doesn\u2019t provide context for how these trial results relate to\u00a0 existing or other experimental treatments, and it makes makes only an oblique reference to the personal financial stakes of a lead researcher. It does not make any reference to cost, even though recently-approved immunotherapy treatments suggest the price tag could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. On the positive side, the release does a good job of explaining why adjuvant treatment to enhance the immune system after bone marrow transplant may be necessary in certain leukemia\u00a0patients. Relapse rates may reveal important clues to how long patients may live or how they will feel, but then again they may not. Any surmised connection between this sort of intermediate endpoint and the things that really mean something to patients must be tested. Until survival or quality of life trials are performed, news releases should not imply that an intermediate endpoint result, such as relapse rate, predicts better or longer life for patients.","label":"false"}

This news release summarizes a published report on data from 18 separate studies worldwide that, when analyzed together, suggest breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of developing childhood or adolescent leukemia. But that\u2019s basically the only message conveyed by the news release, which is otherwise devoid of important context, including \u2014 most importantly \u2014 on the limitations of the observational design used by all of studies in the analysis. The release\u2019s incomplete, one-sided presentation will most likely lead to a flurry of overblown media coverage that could have negative repercussions for the many women who cannot or choose not to breastfeed. There are many reasons for women to think that breastfeeding is a good choice for their babies. Is leukemia prevention one of them? That\u2019s the suggestion of the study reported on here, which is a re-analysis of previous studies examining the question. It\u2019s worthwhile research, but let\u2019s remember that these underlying studies all relied on a backward-looking case-control design that is subject to selection bias and a variety of other potential problems. And the scope of the potential benefit for this condition, which is thankfully quite rare, is limited. Our worry here is that women face a number of physical and lifestyle constraints that may affect their ability to breastfeed. And women who can\u2019t breastfeed already experience guilt that they aren\u2019t doing enough for their babies. Should they also be made to feel as if they are putting their children at increased risk of cancer? That\u2019s not a justifiable message based on this study. But without more careful communication of study limitations and other context, we\u2019re afraid that that\u2019s the message that could ultimately reach the public.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"10089","claim":"Bone drug cuts risk of breast cancer","explanation":"This article presents the preliminary results from STAR, a large clinical trial comparing tamoxifen and raloxifene in postmenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer. The study found comparable reduction in breast cancer risk. While the article reported that for the women taking raloxifene, the incidence of uterine cancer, blood clots, and cataracts were less than the women taking tamoxifen, only the difference in cataract was statically significant. This oversight is major as the incidence of uterine cancer and blood clots may be among the factors a woman considers when deciding which, if either breast cancer risk treatment option, is right for her. The other big omission is that the comparability in breast cancer reduction is only for invasive breast cancer; tamoxifen reduced the risk of less aggressive breast cancer (i.e. ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) while raloxifene did not. If the risks for all breast cancer events had been compared, the reported outcome of the study may have differed.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"8965","claim":"NUS researchers use AI to successfully treat metastatic cancer patient","explanation":"This news release focuses on a paper from Singapore-based researchers who used artificial intelligence (AI) to treat cancer in a single patient.

Unjustifiable language throughout and a lack of attention to key details like harms, cost and an explanation of the severe limitations of the research make this a weak and misleading release. There has been a lot of research focused on the use of AI to help diagnose cancers and develop treatment protocols \u2014 and it continues to be an area of great interest. However, it is difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to draw far-reaching conclusions from a single case. What costs, benefits and risks are associated with AI-directed treatment for cancers? A study like the one highlighted in this release simply cannot tell us. The release claims the researchers were able to improve treatment efficacy by adjusting treatment dose and presumably still minimizing adverse events.

{"claim_id":"9151","claim":"Non-surgical weight-loss treatment found safe, effective for those with limited options","explanation":"More information on potential harms and availability would have made this news release on three medical interventions for weight loss stronger. And addressing the need to complement the procedures with other lifestyle changes would have made the release much stronger. The news release addresses study findings related to the relative success of endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) \u2014 in which the stomach is sutured via a tool introduced through the mouth \u2014 as a less invasive, non-surgical alternative to facilitate weight loss in obese patients. We disagree with the release\u2019s use of the term \u201cnon-surgical\u201d to describe the procedure since it\u00a0involves internal cutting and suturing of internal organs. However, the release does a good job of addressing cost and comparing the outcomes of various procedures. According to the NIH, 35.7 percent of U.S. adults are obese \u2014 and obesity increases an individual\u2019s risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and other health problems. On top of those health risks, obesity also has an adverse effect on an individual\u2019s quality of life. Patients with obesity may view medical procedures, such as ESG, as effective ways of helping them lose weight \u2014 and a study that compares costs and outcomes of several procedures is a useful means of helping patients consider their options. For the most part, the release does a good job here. However, additional insight on the lifestyle choices needed in conjunction with the procedures, and more information on potential harms, would have offered a fuller overview for readers.","label":"MISLEADING"}

After months of Sanders and his staff defending the vote, Sanders\u2019 position started to evolve in October.

{"claim_id":"11630","claim":"Surgeons Move From Knees to Hips","explanation":"This news story introduces readers to arthroscopy as a treatment for hip pain. It explains what the procedure does and the theoretical basis for its potential benefit. But the story fails to mention costs or potential harms, and cites expert testimony in lieu of evidence. In brief:  Costs and Harms: The story mentions neither. Although harms appear to be uncommon, readers should have some sense of their relative frequency and severity. Evidence: the story says that hip arthroscopy can \u201cfix\u201d acetabular labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement. And yet it fails to describe the quality of the evidence to support this claim. There are virtually no high-quality clinical studies to support the treatment. The story also mentions that diagnostic imaging can be unreliable, and suggests that some doctors can pinpoint the diagnosis better than others. But recent literature reviews show that standard diagnostic techniques in use today (imaging and clinical examination) can not accurately or consistently identify the source of pain in people with hip complaints. Readers should understand that when diagnostic techniques are imprecise, people may receive treatments they don\u2019t need or not receive treatments they do. Quantification of Benefits: The story provides no quantitative estimate of benefit in the short or mid term. A surgeon contends that in the long term, \u201chip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis.\u201d News stories should carefully evaluate such claims. In the April 2009 issue of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, editor Richard Brand,MD, concludes a commentary by saying, \u201cWhile current [hip arthroscopy] procedures clearly relieve pain and restore function and to a lesser degree restore motion in large portions of patients, we do not know whether these procedures will delay the development of osteoarthritis in middle age and beyond.\u201d (Clin Orthop Rel Res 2009;467:605-7)    Sources: The story quotes two surgeons who perform a substantial number of hip arthroscopies.

{"claim_id":"11415","claim":"Shingles Vaccine Looks Like a Safe Bet for Seniors: Study","explanation":"This story about a study of how the shingles vaccine performs in regular clinical use does a nice job of putting the pros and cons of the vaccine in a larger context. We also applaud how this story addresses the potential harms of the vaccine. This story reports both the relative risk reduction (55 percent) and absolute risk reduction (from 13 to 6 cases per 1,000 people per year), but we wish it had told readers that 71 people would have to be vaccinated in order to prevent one shingles attack. We encourage broader use of this sort of statistic about the number of people you need to treat in order for at least one person to benefit. However, like the other stories, this one does not tackle the limitations inherent in this sort of observational study. Shingles is a terribly painful condition caused by the chicken pox virus. It often reemerges late in life. Although a large clinical trial demonstrated that a vaccine could reduce the risk of shingles attacks and postherpetic neuralgia under idealized conditions, things are often different in the real world. This study of actual clinical experience adds an important perspective on the effects of the vaccine, but stories about this sort of study need to clearly address the limitations of observational trials and the ways that bias and confounding factors can muddy the results. Finally, the take-home message here is a clear need to promote shared decision-making between caregivers and patients on this issue, because this is not a slam dunk must-do vaccine.","label":"true"}

Although the background material for the article is complicated, this article is less helpful to a reader than it ought to be. Without presenting how often the events like heart attack, stroke, heart arrhythmias or kidney disorders occur, it is not possible for an individual to evaluate how much concern it causes them. Although these are serious risks and individuals thinking about or currently taking these medications should consider them, the article did a a poor job of clearly delineating treatment options. There is confusion about the various risks and how they differ among the available treatment options. Though the article mentioned sticking with a drug which hasn\u2019t caused problems in the past, waiting seven years after FDA approval before trying a new medication, using naproxen plus an acid-reflux drug (without specifying the class that is most successful in this role) and recommending use of \u2018pain ointments\u2019, it did a poor job of clarifying how a given individual should assess these options and how they apply to themselves.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"10678","claim":"Testing hand-grip strength could be a simple, low-cost way to predict heart attack and stroke risk","explanation":"This release about the ability of grip strength testing to predict death and disease rates leaves readers without enough context and ultimately overstates the importance of the findings. While the tone of the release is measured and the quotes include some caution about interpreting the results, there\u2019s no mention anywhere in the release about the limits of observational studies \u2014 which are discussed both in the study that\u2019s the basis for the release and the accompanying editorial. And although overall death rates are unquestionably an important outcome, the release does not tell readers what it would mean for a person to be identified as having a 17 percent higher risk. What use is that information and how would it affect how that person is cared for? \u201cWhy This Matters\u201d is something this news release should have educated us about. A clinical test result is useful only when it helps people make decisions. This release should have spent more time addressing how the study results might be applied. Would identifying a person as being at a 17 percent increased risk of death or a 7 percent increased risk of a heart attack change how doctors would monitor or treat him or her? Would someone be prescribed a statin based on a finding of decreased hand grip strength? Even though the study was intended only to assess how grip test results in a wider variety of countries compare to previous findings in high-income countries, the release could have at least briefly mentioned how such test results are commonly used in clinical settings. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s clear that news coverage, feeding off this news release, is reporting on this without caveats about observational studies, and therefore, delivering an incomplete message to the public. And it all started with this news release, because the caveats appear in both the journal article and in an accompanying commentary.

{"claim_id":"10980","claim":"Immunotherapy reduces cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis","explanation":"This news release asserts that a study found that combining two\u00a0biologic drugs\u00a0which contain\u00a0extra-low doses of antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) and interferon (IFN) can \u201cimprove the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk.\u201d But the accuracy of that statement depends on what your definition of \u201ccardiovascular risk\u201d is. If your definition includes the risk of heart attacks and strokes (as it surely does for most people), then the statement is questionable at best. The release does not mention any of those outcomes and instead focuses on \u201cunstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure.\u201d The news release is rich in mechanistic details, ie: how the treatments\u2019 processes may help reduce markers of cardiovascular risk, but poor in important details of interest such as potential harms, costs and impacts on heart attacks or strokes. Granted, it was\u00a0a small study, but it would have benefited from appropriate caveats around the actual outcomes observed, the potential for harms, and an overall sense of context. [Editor\u2019s note: The European Society of Cardiology, which issued the release, has appeared on HealthNewsReview.org\u2019s Wall of Shame twice before (see here and here) and this release comes close to meriting a repeat appearance.] In rheumatoid arthritis cytokines, a type of proteibn such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN), start to attack healthy cells. If low-dose anti-TNF or anti-IFN drugs could reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis as well as decrease cardiovascular risk they may make a huge contribution to\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. If\u00a0many people with rheumatoid arthritis also have a higher risk of\u00a0cardiovascular disease it is useful to\u00a0study\u00a0if biologic drugs can reduce those risks\u00a0by slowing down or halting\u00a0the disease process.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"9415","claim":"Sleep apnea patient finds rest with implant device: \"It saved my life","explanation":"Inspire Therapy implant The story focuses on one patient\u2019s experience with a technology called Inspire, which is an implantable device used to treat one particular form of sleep apnea (obstructive). While sleep apnea is a common problem in the United States, the story does little to place the work in context. Instead, the story cites a medical professional who calls it \u201crevolutionary\u201d and a \u201cgame-changer\u201d without telling readers that the doctor is a consultant for Inspire. There is also no objective medical assessment of the device\u2019s effectiveness, as the medical professional quoted is also the treating physician. It\u2019s also not clear why the story came out now, given that Inspire has been on the market for a few years and that the evidence cited is from 2014. We are happy for any patient who has found relief for a medical problem. But the treatment that works for one patient may not work or even be appropriate for others. It is important for any story about medical treatments to offer detailed information about the costs, risks and benefits of a treatment, rather than relying on one person\u2019s story. This is true for any treatment, but especially for medical devices, which are not tightly regulated by the FDA.

{"claim_id":"11623","claim":"Injection to treat alcoholism OK\u2019d","explanation":"This article highlights a different approach for the treatment of alcoholism, namely a monthly injection of an opioid antagonist in conjunction with counseling or group therapy. The allure of this drug is that the oral medication performs well among those who take it. This may be a welcome treatment regimen for individuals seeking help for their alcoholism. Perhaps because of side-effects or for other reasons, compliance with the pill is not great, so this once-a-month treatment is attractive on the face of it. Unfortunatelly, this story provides little information about the efficacy of this treatment. Trials of the drug showed that about 15% of patients stopped taking the drug during the 6 month trial because of side effects, but the story didn\u2019t mention this. The story also didn\u2019t mention that the trials showed high rates of anorexia, nausea and fatigue among the actively treated subjects. In fact, no details on the clinical trials or the views of experts in the field were provided. The story only included quotes from drug company spokesmen.

{"claim_id":"14657","claim":"Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don\u2019t have that (gun ownership)\u00a0database.","explanation":"Rep. Loretta Sanchez said in a recent interview that California Attorney General Kamala Harris has done \"nothing\" to address a backlog of cases in a high-profile gun ownership tracking system. The database allows law enforcement to seize guns from people with criminal records and mental illness. \"So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn\u2019t be able to purchase guns \u2013 by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don\u2019t have that database,\" Sanchez said. Not only does the program exist, but some progress has been made. The backlog has been cut from more than 20,000 cases to 12,700. That\u2019s after Harris\u2019 office spent $15 million of $24 million allocated by the Legislature and governor. Some continue to argue that the cases should be cleared more quickly, citing the mass shootings that have continued across the country. But there\u2019s no denying that the Attorney General\u2019s Office, under Harris, has put a dent in the backlog, allowing for the seizure of thousands of guns.

{"claim_id":"10625","claim":"Drug could fight effects of aging","explanation":"This story notes that using growth hormone to counteract the effects of aging is controversial and that it is not FDA approved for this use, yet the story mentions growth hormone is available in \u201canti-aging\u201d clinics. The term \u2018anti-aging\u2019 is a misnomer, as there are no proven medical interventions to stop or reverse the process of aging. Federal law states that distributing or administering human growth hormone for age-related health problems or for cosmetic use is illegal. Growth hormone is currently only approved for adults with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) and for children with pituitary disorders. The promotion of growth hormone to counteract the effects of aging, namely a decline in physical functioning, is not new; however, the benefit of this use has not been established and the long-term safety is unknown. In this randomized controlled study, an increase in physical functioning was reported in the growth hormone group, but we are not told the degree of this benefit, or if the difference in functioning (measured by improved balance, climbing stairs and heel-to-toe walking) between this group and the placebo group was statistically significant. This story notes that diet and exercise are preferred methods of prevention for staying healthy and functional as we age. However, the story focuses on the notion that normal physical decline involved with aging needs to be counteracted with a pill, such as growth hormone. The natural decline in growth hormones with age may actually be protective. The comparison of prescription eye-glasses for older adults with taking growth hormone to improve physical functioning is unfounded and qualifies as disease mongering. Eyeglasses are an intervention to improve a manifestation of aging, i.e. degenerating eyesight, and glasses pose few (if any) risks to physical health. Growth hormone may pose serious risks to the endocrine and cardiovascular systems, and long-term use may actually reduce longevity by increasing the risk of prostate cancer in older men. The only sources of information appear to be researchers who presented their work at a scientific meeting. (There can be problems with such reporting. See \u201cMedia reporting on research presented at scientific meetings: more caution needed,\u201d at: http:\/\/www.mja.com.au\/public\/issues\/184_11_050606\/wol10024_fm.html) The story does note that the study was sponsored by Pfizer, maker of the growth hormone drug capromorelin, but there is no independent reporting or corroboration with sources not affiliated with the study.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"9204","claim":"Personalized treatment for those in blood pressure 'gray zone'","explanation":"This news release describes an analysis of data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study showing a link between a buildup of calcium in coronary arteries and heart attacks in patients with borderline high blood pressure, referred to here as \u201cprehypertension.\u201d The study asserts that coronary artery calcification (CAC) can be used to guide treatment decisions for these \u201cgray zone\u201d patients. Aside from an overreaching headline and sub-headline, the news release delivers essential information including costs, harms, availability, and study limitations. Nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults have prehypertension, defined as blood pressure between 120 and 139 for the first number (systolic) and\/or 80 to 89 for the second number (diastolic). Preypertension is associated with a higher risk of heart attack as well as a heightened risk of developing high blood pressure, which increases the risk of stroke. But the concept of \u201cprehypertension\u201d is somewhat controversial. The most recent hypertension guidelines (JNC 8) do not include this classification. It\u2019s still a leap of faith to imply that identifying this risk group and more aggressively treating their blood pressure would significantly reduce their cardiovascular risk. Patients generally are advised to make lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss, but medication is sometimes prescribed. A tool to better determine which patients would benefit from aggressive treatment \u2014 as coronary artery calcification scans might prove to be \u2014 could help clinicians make better recommendations, improving outcomes and reducing costs.","label":"true"}

It includes valuable comments that help readers understand what was found and, more importantly, some of the limitations on what is known. However, the lead sentence skews the story by highlighting that researchers saw a 20 percent relative difference in lung cancer death rates, while failing to make it clear that the absolute difference in death rates was much less than one percent, because of the small number of few lung cancer deaths in either the CT (354 or 1.32%) or x-ray (442 or 1.65%) group compared to the size of the total trial population (about 53,500). The National Cancer Institute reported that 300 smokers would have to undergo screening in order for one life to be extended. Readers should have been shown that aspect of the results. Putting a spotlight on relative differences in rates usually magnifies the effects of an intervention. Absolute numbers \u2013 and the number of people that need to undergo the intervention in order for at least one to benefit \u2013 should get at least equal billing in order to put trial results into perspective.","label":"true"}

The researchers found no increased risk of asthma, depression, lung cancer or mental illness, which the story seems to accept as a big reassurance. We felt the story did not squarely address the study limitations as described by the authors themselves in the paper. Instead, the \u201csurprising news\u201d came in a single-source story, lifting quotes from a news release, without any independent perspective or adequate context. Millions of individuals, of all ages, are making current decisions about medical and recreational marijuana use every day. Medical research on the health impacts of that exposure matter for each person and for society as a whole. This story over-valued the conclusion of a single small study based on a sample of only young men. Yes, the study results were interesting and indeed add to a body of knowledge about the use of marijuana by adolescents but it is by no means definitive.

{"claim_id":"9007","claim":"Researchers use smart phone to make a faster infection detector","explanation":"This news release about a smartphone-based infectious disease testing device confuses speed and device cost with benefits to patients and public health. It oversimplifies infectious disease detection and response. In their published study, the researchers reported an important achievement: comparable accuracy (under ideal conditions) with existing lab devices. However, the release doesn\u2019t point out vital distinctions between performance in the lab and in real-world field use, or between the cost of a device and the total cost of a public health program that uses such a device. The release does not put the status of this device into context with other similar devices being developed by universities and companies around the world. We note that the release does report the funding source and the commercial intentions of the researchers. News releases should include essential context, not just certain facts that put researchers\u2019 work in the most positive light. This release focuses narrowly on accuracy comparisons between an experimental device and existing lab equipment. It leaves reporters and other readers to discover on their own how this device compares to similar experimental products. The release highlights potential real-world health benefits without acknowledging the complex questions that need to be asked before anyone can know whether this device can deliver on the promises. Infectious diseases are still a significant source of mortality and morbidity especially in low\u00a0and middle income countries. A device that could improve the diagnosis of these diseases would be useful in\u00a0these settings.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":"11506","claim":"Lipogen Targets PMS\/PMDD Relief, Naturally","explanation":"This news release announces an Israel-based company\u2019s success in obtaining a U.S. patent for a proprietary \u201cphospholipid formulation\u201d called PS Plus, which is purported to treat physical and \u201cemotional\u201d symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Somewhat misleadingly, the release suggests the formulation was \u201cdesigned\u201d to address PMS and PMDD, when in fact it appears to be the same single-ingredient supplement already sold to provide \u201cbrain support,\u201d \u201csharpen memory\u201d and ameliorate \u201cstress.\u201d Prevalence statistics presented in the release are contradictory and qualitatively lightweight. There is evidence in the literature of some clinical testing of phosphatidic acid, a natural phospholipid, or fatty acid derivative of soy lecithin, used as a carrier for some experimental drugs, but it is the only active ingredient mentioned on the product website \u2013 and not at all in the release \u2014 and there is precious little information about other ingredients or costs anywhere. PMS is a very common health condition in women of reproductive age. As such, women in this age group and in many countries may be interested in \u201cnatural\u201d remedies to alleviate some of the symptoms. Additionally, Americans are high users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. Recent studies have noted that in the United States, \u201capproximately 38 percent of adults (about 4 in 10) and approximately 12 percent of children (about 1 in 9) are using some form of CAM.\u201d Moreover, CAM use among adults is greater among women and those with higher levels of education and higher incomes \u2013 exactly the population this news release is trying to reach. The supplement industry\u2019s so-called \u201corthomolecular\u201d therapies, which claim to maintain health with the use of natural compounds, have long been the subject of public health and scientific controversy, and come-and-go fads among consumers who spends millions on supplements for which rigorous evidence of clinical value is at best scant. For an aging population of boomers, in particular, the promise of protecting and boosting brain health (and by inference reducing the risk of age-related dementia), has been especially appealing, particularly if the products claim to be \u201cnatural\u201d and with no ill effects. Similarly, for younger women, claims of safe, natural relief for \u00a0PMS and related syndromes are appealing, given that the conditions have long been \u201cmedicalized,\u201d and such treatments as hormone replacement therapy and anti-depressants \u2014 all carrying risks and adverse effects \u2014 \u00a0have been over-prescribed and costly. Consequently, there is likely to be substantial interest in a product that promises to relieve what the release says are \u201cmore than 200 different symptoms\u201d of PMS, and protect and enhance brain function.","label":"false"}

It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom\u2019s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study.

{"claim_id":"11330","claim":"Fish oil linked to lower Alzheimer\u2019s risk","explanation":"This story reported on the findings from a recent research study that found lower rates of dementia in individuals who had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their blood. They were also able to show individuals who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week were found to have higher levels of DHA. The reporting about this study is a good example of where the relative risk reduction sounds impressive but the absolute risk reduction is small. Yet the story provided only the relative risk numbers, not the absolute. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) Although it's good that the story pointed out the harms that are associated with fish oil consumption and the lack of FDA approval of fish oil as a means to prevent dementia, it neglected to mention that there currently are no evidence-based means to reduce the incidence of dementia. The story also ought to have included information about other reasons the authors might have found the results they did (chance, confouding dietary or behavioral patterns, etc). Because it is possible that these and not the fish consumption per se are associated with reduced dementia, it\u00a0is information that a reader\u00a0should be aware\u00a0of. The headline of the story \u2013 \"Fish Oil Linked to Lower Alzheimer's Risk\" \u2013 is somewhat misleading because the results of the story demonstrated that fish oil was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia; when an attempt was made to parse out the effect of fish oil on Alzheimer's disease specifically, its effect was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this story was not the only one to fail to appreciate this distinction. The editorial accompanying this research in the Archives of Neurology was entitled \"Docosahexaenoic Acid and Alzheimer Disease\" and nowhere in the editorial was the distinction made between Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9212","claim":"New study finds EPA and DHA omega-3s lower risk of coronary heart disease","explanation":"This news release summarizes a recent paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings that evaluated the effect two types of omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) \u2014 had on reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The report was a meta-analysis, meaning researchers evaluated the findings of multiple published studies. Specifically, the meta-analysis looked at 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies. RCTs are designed to measure the effect of a specific intervention under clearly-defined, experimental conditions. This means that researchers aim to determine, with some degree of certainty, whether a specific intervention is causing a specific outcome. Prospective cohort studies follow large groups of people over extended periods of time, allowing researchers to determine what characteristics or behaviors may be associated with specific outcomes. Because of the nature of these cohort studies, they can only tell researchers if a behavior or practice is correlated with an outcome \u2014 but not whether the behavior is causing the outcome. These sorts of meta-analyses can be extremely valuable tools for assessing a broad body of work on a given subject. However, this news release is problematic. It is written in a way that is confusing, if not misleading, and fails to make clear that the scientific-sounding organization that funded the study (and wrote the release) is an industry group that was created to promote the global use of omega-3 supplements or foods that are high in omega-3s. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, approximately 370,000 people die of coronary heart disease each year in the United States. Many adults make decisions about their diet, activities and lifestyle based on how those decisions may affect their heart health. Research on subjects such as how omega-3 fatty acids affect heart disease risk play an important role here. According to a 2015 Washington Post article, people in the U.S. spend $1.2 billion each year on fish oil supplements, largely because they contain omega-3s that consumers think will reduce their risk of heart disease. But increasingly consistent evidence shows that fish oil does not, in fact, protect against heart disease. If people are going to make informed decisions about their personal health \u2014 and how they spend their money \u2014 they need to have good information that they can actually understand. News releases like this one make it hard for most consumers to understand exactly what the research says.","label":"false"}

The patients were divided into two groups: One group of patients were sent home early while taking rivaroxaban (Xarelto), a type of blood thinner, whereas the \u201cusual care\u201d group could get any blood thinner of their physician\u2019s choosing, including rivaroxaban, and hospitalization. The study findings suggest that early discharge of low-risk patients was safe and feasible and also resulted in cost savings because of less time spent in hospital. Unfortunately, the news release seemed to suggest that it was the use of rivaroxaban that resulted in cost savings\u2013rather than the strategy of sending low risk patients home early. The news release failed to state was that over half the patients in the comparison group who got usual care also received rivaroxaban. In other words, the news release implies that rivaroxaban was being compared to other anti-coagulants when what was actually being compared was an early vs. late discharge strategy.

The abstract of the study is being presented at the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s annual meeting, and the association issued this news release as part of its conference outreach. The news release does an admirable job of explaining the experimental design that led to this finding, getting specific about the nature of the participants and using language understandable to lay audiences.

{"claim_id":"11009","claim":"Bioidentical hormones for menopausal symptoms","explanation":"Bio-identical hormone therapy\u00a0is a poorly-defined term for using\u00a0a set of hormones that are molecularly identical to natural hormones in the body. Proponents of this treatment claim\u00a0that bio-identical hormones are\u00a0safer and more effective\u00a0than conventional hormone therapy for treating the symptoms of menopause, however there is no evidence to support these claims. Furthermore, hormones are expected to have the same risk and benefits\u00a0as approved drugs for which there is an evidence base\u00a0as well as extensive research and regulation. Many medical organizations, both in the US and internationally, have issued statements raising concerns about the claims made about bio-identical hormones. This story does a good job of raising awareness about this issue, although it should have noted that many women don\u2019t experience symptoms in the same way and\u00a0that\u00a0treatment with bio-identical hormones or traditional hormones should only be used by women who are bothered by their symptoms and not\u00a0if they are trying to\u00a0prevent heart disease. The story could have been greatly improved by coming down harder on the proponents of bio-identical hormones. While the story\u00a0includes a debate on whether there is evidence to support the use of bio-identical hormones, in doing so, it gives the impression that there really is a debate. Bio-identical hormone supporters claim that there have been dozens of clinical trials showing a benefit. However,\u00a0a 2007 systematic review\u00a0found \"a dearth of scientific evidence to support these claims\". The story should have been more critical of the evidence base to support the use of bio-identical hormones. This is a subject sure to attract attention, given the wide range of troublesome symptoms experienced by many women during the menopausal transition. It is important for women to be aware of the potential risks of uNPRoven therapies, including\u00a0bioidentical hormone preparations,\u00a0that may be \"prescribed\" by alternative health clinics.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"11525","claim":"Study shows children's best hope for the potassium and fiber missing in their diets is potatoes","explanation":"This news release is about a study funded by and written by the potato industry. And not surprisingly given its provenance, the news release advocates vigorously for the inclusion of more potatoes in children\u2019s diets. Interestingly, though, the study that\u2019s the basis for the release does not deliver the same message. Instead, it says that a broad array of vegetables are not being eaten by children and therefore children\u2019s diets are lacking in calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients. Potatoes are a big focus of the study, of course, but here\u2019s where the news release falls short, too: The study notes \u2014 and the news release ignores \u2014 that the potatoes being studied included french fries and potato chips. All potential health harm from these foods is completely ignored. (Such harm is ignored in the study, too.) The potential benefits are not clearly broken out in the study and seem to appear out of nowhere in the news release. Childhood intake of nutrients has been linked to later development of cancer and cardiovascular disease, as well as obesity and diabetes. As the release states, childhood eating patterns carry over to adults. Encouraging kids to eat a wide variety of vegetables is therefore important. The argument that potatoes should be particularly encouraged has little foundation in science.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"10416","claim":"Erbitux OK for colorectal cancer patients with genetic marker","explanation":"This report describes a study showing that colon cancer patients whose tumors have a certain genetic mutation don\u2019t benefit from the drug Erbitux. Since that drug is expensive and has serious side effects, it\u2019s important to know which patients will benefit. This study confirms previous research into the question. The story follows nearly all medical journalism best practices, as the ratings show. It could have been improved in two ways:  It might have put the studied treatment in context to other clinical approaches used to treat metastatic colon cancer. In the second paragraph, it says that the drug \"doesn\u2019t work\" in patients whose tumors have the genetic mutation. But it does not return to verify or elaborate on this point in less vernacular language. For instance, later on the story reports that patients whose tumors do not have the mutation showed significant tumor shrinkage. It would have been useful to reiterate that patients who did have the mutation and took Erbitux saw outcomes no different from those taking the placebo\u2013the core finding that supports the \"doesn\u2019t work\" formulation at the top of the story. It\u2019s also important to note that tumor shrinkage should not be equated with considerable benefit \u2013 which should be expressed in terms of improved survival, lower recurrence or improved quality of life. Overall, though, this story was well done, and it took only 391 words to do such a good job.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"9183","claim":"Nonsurgical treatment can correct congenital ear malformations in infants","explanation":"Infant ear, before and after. Image: Becon Medical website The news release focuses on a recent journal article that evaluates the use of a nonsurgical treatment called the \u201cEarWell system\u201d to treat malformations of the ear in newborn infants. The news release reports that results were judged \u201cgood to excellent\u201d for most patients in the retrospective study. However, the release poses some significant problems for readers. For example, the release doesn\u2019t discuss cost and does not tell readers that the study co-author quoted extensively is the inventor of the EarWell system. The release also treats ear deformation and ear malformation interchangeably \u2014 a distinction made clearly in the relevant journal article. This is particularly important because the numbers discussed in the news release sometimes refer to patients with deformities and sometimes to patients with malformation. Ear malformations and ear deformations are not the same thing. As the journal article itself makes clear, \u201cdeformations are characterized by a misshapen but fully developed pinna [or external portion of the ear] with no missing skin or cartilage,\u201d whereas \u201cmalformations demonstrate a partial absence of skin and\/or cartilage resulting in an underdeveloped pinna from an error in embryologic development.\u201d The headline, section headline and first three paragraphs all refer solely to malformations. Deformity is mentioned for the first time in paragraph four, and in such a way as to make many (if not most) readers assume the terms deformity and malformation are interchangeable. But they\u2019re not interchangeable. Here\u2019s one reason that matters: the release later tells readers that \u201cresults were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity.\u201d And, based on the journal article, that\u2019s true. But it wasn\u2019t true for ear malformations \u2014 which is what the headline and opening paragraphs would lead readers to expect. Parents of newborn infants want to do what\u2019s best for their children, and having to make medical decisions for their infants is a stressful and emotional ordeal. Those decisions can be particularly tricky when the medical decision to be treated is not life threatening. Confusing news releases do not help people make informed decisions under any circumstances, but that is particularly true in circumstances as fraught as those facing parents of a newborn.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, most of which are within the gut, and their genetic makeup. The results indicated that volunteers who underwent dTMS lost more weight and fat mass than those who had a sham procedure and that changes were seen in the microbiome profile in individuals who\u2019d had dTMS. The release didn\u2019t discuss any changes in the sham group, and there was no discussion of where these results fit within the total body of evidence in this area of research. Most importantly, the release takes significant liberties by stating that\u00a0dTMS can directly impact microbes living in the gut, without considering the impact that weight loss and lifestyle changes have on microbial composition. Employing a more cautious interpretation of the results, and including a discussion of costs, risks, and comparisons to other weight loss treatments would have significantly improved the release. Researchers and clinicians work relentlessly every day to find treatments for obesity and its chronic health consequences, and yet, new, safe and effective techniques are few and far between. It\u2019s well known that obesity treatment and management are critical concerns in the United States and abroad. Any new technique that might influence weight loss, appetite, or the gut microbiome is exciting to consider, given that lifestyle changes and prescription weight loss drugs often have limited long-term impacts. However, this news release overstates and oversimplifies the results of the study without fully addressing the complex interplay between weight loss, metabolic hormones and neurotransmitters (the brain\u2019s chemical messengers), and the microbes living in our gut. Change in one of these components typically doesn\u2019t proceed without the others, and the mechanisms are extremely intricate and multifaceted. This release seems to leap from Point A to Point C in a conclusion that does not show appropriate and cautious interpretation of the results of this very small study.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"11207","claim":"Mixed Outcomes in Laparoscopy for Prostates","explanation":"This newspaper article reports on the findings of a study that compares prevalence and outcomes of minimally invasive laparoscopic prostate removal with the standard \"open\" surgical method. The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology provide a useful snapshot at a time when laparoscopic surgery is rapidly becoming popular. The news article does a solid job of describing the findings in detail and providing comments from independent sources who help interpret them. The reader takes away the idea that laparoscopic surgeries, despite their increased popularity, appear to have significant potential harms. But the article leaves some major questions unanswered. First, the newspaper report does not mention costs. Robot-assisted procedures are inherently controversial because the equipment is so costly but the benefits unknown. By not mentioning costs of the surgery, the article strips the findings of context. Second, the study itself looks at a very narrow question\u2013it compares the two surgical approaches in a 65-plus population. But the analysis did not account for disease state, mortality, the side effects of surgery men are most likely to care about (impotence and incontinence), or even whether the laparoscopic procedures were robot-assisted. The possibility that selection bias colors the findings is obvious. This is an important piece of research in the field.

{"claim_id":"10543","claim":"Blood test that could predict arthritis risk","explanation":"This release from the University of Oxford describes a new blood test that researchers there developed after zeroing in on the protein that collects in the joints of people with rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of the protein can predict the advance of rheumatoid arthritis many years before arthritis symptoms develop, according to the research findings published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. Among some of the 2,000 individuals who were part of the study, the protein, called tenascin-C, was found as many as 16 years before disease symptoms appeared. The release does a good job describing the science behind the test but may leave readers wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d That\u2019s because we aren\u2019t told when and where the test will be available and there\u2019s no mention of early treatment strategies \u2014 what the options are, what they entail, how long it lasts and what it might cost. Most doctors screen for rheumatoid arthritis among patients presenting with joint symptoms. Tests to diagnose RA aren\u2019t perfect but have gotten better over time.

As such, it would be predicting future RA in patients who do not yet have symptoms or other findings such as arthritis changes on x-rays. Identifying patients with so-called \u201cpre-RA\u201d might appear to be a good thing, but it may not be as simple as implied in this news release. First, it is one thing to retrospectively examine whether blood samples performed years earlier\u00a0can identify people we\u2019ve already classified. The next logical step would be to prospectively see if we can take patients who don\u2019t have any symptoms and use the test to say \u201cpositive or negative\u201d and then wait to see if the test correctly predicts a future diagnosis. This is complicated by the need to say who should we use the test on. Everyone? Someone who may be at risk for other reasons? It isn\u2019t clear and the news release doesn\u2019t help us. Second, since no test is perfect and there inevitably will be false-positives, what does it mean to label someone as being likely to develop future RA if in fact they won\u2019t? Third, even if the test is correct, it isn\u2019t clear what to do with the results. Should we start treating these patients with medications to prevent future symptoms? If the treatments had no side effects, one could argue to do so. But we know that the treatments for RA all have side effects, some quite serious. For those with debilitating symptoms, the risks of such medications may be justified. But for someone who has no such symptoms, it isn\u2019t as clear. One would like to see studies saying that use of this test result leads to better outcomes. No such data exists. Finally, there is no effort to state what would be the potential costs of using such a test in routine practice. One would not only need to consider the cost of the test itself, but also the downstream costs associated with treatment and the potential savings in terms of RA complications avoided.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"14845","claim":"Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception\" five times.","explanation":"The post on Clinton\u2019s website claims\u00a0\"Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception\" five times. There\u2019s little doubt that Cruz is a strong opponent of abortion, and as such, he and other anti-abortion advocates find certain types of contraception objectionable. But the Clinton campaign\u2019s examples don\u2019t exactly show Cruz trying to push across-the-board bans on contraception. The strongest conclusion about Cruz\u2019s views that one could draw from these examples is that he might support a ban on certain types of contraception (but not all) through his support for a personhood amendment. The other examples are even more limited and deal with what employers would be required to pay for, for instance, or whether a major birth control provider should continue to receive federal funding.

Meanwhile, the five-hour figure is just one of three measurements of E.R. wait times -- and not even necessarily the best one. If you count from the time of a patient's arrival to being seen by a health care professional, the wait time was 31 minutes in California. Even the strongest support for the claim is far from solid: A survey of emergency physicians found signs that E.R. traffic had increased since the ACA took effect in January, but the results were mixed, and this documents patient volume, not wait times.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"9891","claim":"UNC Hearing Loss Experts Lead Clinical Trials of FDA-Approved Hearing Implant","explanation":"Synchrony EAS (electric acoustic stimulation) hearing implant. Image credit: Med-El USA, the device manufacturerThis news release from the University of North Carolina purports to advise journalists and the public about clinical\u00a0research from the university that helped gain recent FDA approval for an implantable hearing device designed for adults with a form of moderate to severe hearing loss. But this news release is a not-very-thinly veiled infomercial for the device\u2019s maker, and a promotional piece for and by the head of the university department whose faculty members clearly stand to benefit from marketing it. The release is full of hyperbolic praise for the device (\u201cThe technology is remarkable and so were the results\u2026\u201d) and the university\u2019s role in the clinical trials. But it is very light on quantitative data and information about costs, complications and side effects that would help readers judge the pros and cons of an invasive cochlear implant. The release offers no links or references to published, peer-reviewed data; to the manufacturer\u2019s website; or notes on potential conflicts of interest. There is some useful information about the prevalence of hearing loss in the U.S. and about what is novel about the implant. But this releases reads more like a commercial brochure than an informative and educational summary for public awareness. Hearing loss is indeed a significant and growing problem and a threat to an aging population. In recent years, hearing loss has been tied by research to cognitive loss (as described in this 2013 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine), as well as social isolation, traffic accidents and a host of other physical, emotional and social ills. Because Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers do not cover the cost of hearing aids \u2014 which can run into the thousands of dollars for state-of-the-art devices \u2014 most adults who need them don\u2019t have them. For the most severe, disabling forms of \u201csensorineural\u201d \u00a0hearing loss, cochlear implants can be life-changing, and the device described in this release could have novelty and benefits in addressing both high and low frequency hearing problems. Significantly, most insurance, including Medicare, covers the cost of the device and implant surgery. But the benefits of the implants come with risks, including the need for general anesthesia, damage to facial nerves, infections, tinnitus, and numbness. Adjustment to the devices can take months of habilitative services \u2014 and removal rates remain high in some populations. Long-term effects, moreover, still are largely unknown. For all these reasons, news releases and stories about surgical implants should offer context about the benefits, risks, costs and alternatives.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"11529","claim":"New Merck osteoporosis drug boosts bone density","explanation":"This story, about results from a Phase II trial of Merck\u2019s new osteoporosis drug odanacatib, should not have been published in a mainstream publication. Phase II results are not necessarily predictive of Phase III results or of FDA approval. Readers looking for new treatments for osteoporosis are likely to assume incorrectly that safety, efficacy and availability are assured. The reporter could have tempered the story by interviewing independent experts with no stake in the drug being studied, who likely would have pointed this out. Further, by talking to an independent clinician, the reporter could have learned about existing treatments for osteoporosis and how this one could\u2013possibly, and at some point in the future\u2013compare. Supplements, diet and exercise have been shown to slow or even halt osteoporosis for some patients. So have some drugs currently on the market. The story also fails to clarify a point that would be valuable to consumers: That risk of fracture, not bone mass density, is the most meaningful outcome for osteoporosis drugs. Because this trial did not look at that outcome, the drug\u2019s practical clinical value remains untested. The report should have plainly stated this caveat. And finally, it is well known that osteoporosis is a \"big market opportunity\" in the pharma trade. In other words, new drugs in this field, if well-publicized and well-marketed, can be huge revenue and profit drivers for the company. By failing to mention price, and the very strong financial motivation for a company to be first-to-market with a novel drug in this category, the reporter misses an opportunity to help educate readers about a source of rising healthcare costs\u2013and to invite a skeptical view of news about unpublished Phase II results about this drug.

{"claim_id":"11527","claim":"Back Pain: Revolution: Replacement Disc Surgery","explanation":"This story is about a new treatment option for low back pain \u2013 artificial disk replacement. For viewers suffering from low back pain, trying to make a treatment decision, there is too much crucial information missing in this story. Most people with low back pain will not be eligible for the device. Viewers need to understand how little is known about the risks of the device and how it compares to other treatment options. Even if the short-term risks\/benefits look good, there will be major unanswered questions abouts the durability and long-term safety of the device. The 25 year old woman in this story may require additional spine surgery in the future as this device wears out. This is not intended to be a one-time cure. In the story, the viewer learns that \u201cMore than 75% of Americans suffer back pain at some time.\u201d While this may be technically correct, it\u2019s not clear that all find it \u201csignificant.\u201d The kind of back pain that would make an individual eligible for disc replacement surgery represents a very small percentage of all cases of back pain. Most people suffer acute episodes of back pain that resolves on its own. More importantly, the story implies that \u201cinjured discs are often to blame.\u201d In fact, only a small percentage of low back pain is attributable to an acute disc herniation. Finally, the statement that \u201cdoctors have treated problems by fusing spinal bones together\u201d is unclear and also misleading. Most patients with low back pain are not going to need surgery of any type. For patients with an acute disc herniation, the accepted procedure is a discectomy, not fusion. The story does quantify the benefits of treatment. Although the story quotes the surgeon saying he has had good results, this is not sufficient. The audience deserves more than just a single surgeon\u2019s experience and a couple of days experience in one patient. Although the story mentions that the patient tried accupuncture and electrical stimulation, the story neglects other alternatives and does not discuss the pros and cons of the alternatives. The story does not mention harms. The story does not mention either short-term risks of surgery, or the short to long-term risks of the device itself. Given that the ideal candidate is a young, otherwise healthy person, the device would need to work for many decades. Some early results demonstrate failure rates of 30% after a few years. Furthermore, the story fails to indicate whether disc replacement is available or not, does not describe the quality of the available evidence, and does not mention costs (which could be substantial). Even with the time constraints of TV news, much more could have been done with this story if the topic was to be covered at all.","label":"false"}

Autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of problems with social communication and interaction, as well as behavioral issues that can be repetitive, compulsive, and\/or disruptive in many social settings.

{"claim_id":"11558","claim":"Less Radiation OK for Breast Cancer","explanation":"The story reports on a study of shorter course of radiation therapy for women with early stage breast cancer . Results of this study were presented at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting and have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. (The limitations of interpreting such findings could have been emphasized.) The story notes that more long-term data may be needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the shorter course of radiation treatment. The story notes that this shorter course treatment is for women who have cancer confined to the breast. The story lists some options for radiation treatment following breast cancer surgery; however, it does not mention partial breast radiation and other alternatives to traditional radiation currently being tested. The story describes the study and provides recurrence rates at 5 years \u2013 from 2-5% in all groups. We are told that doctors \"believe the treatments are equivalent\", but \"cannot say so with certainty\", meaning in lay terms the difference was not statistically significant. It is important to note that this is a large study, which is good, but we do not know well it translates (e.g. what size tumors did these women have, what was the margin status, what type of systemic therapy). It would be good to note that results controlled for all these other factors. More data on side effects in the groups would also be useful. The story does list some of the side effects of radiation, namely skin and breast tissue changes, and notes these were less common in women who had a shorter course of radiation. Fatigue is also a common side effect of radiation, but this is not mentioned. Time, energy and the expense of travelling to more radiation treatments may influence a women\u2019s decision for breast cancer surgery. The story does not list the cost of radiation treatments; however, what is really at stake here is time lost from work or other activities. All of these may play into a woman\u2019s decision to forego radiation or to have a mastectomy vs. lumpectomy with radiation.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":"9652","claim":"New Stroke Treatment Saves Lives, Improves Recovery","explanation":"This is a story about an invasive procedure to treat stroke patients, known as stent retriever therapy. Unfortunately, the story presents a misleading picture to readers by relying on one\u00a0successful\u00a0patient anecdote, and by making unqualified statements, such as \u201cexperts call the [procedure] the most major advance in stroke treatment in two decades.\u201d Scant attention is paid to the actual benefits quantified in the study that is the meat\u00a0of the story. No attention is paid to the possible harms of the procedure. Costs are never mentioned, and there is no real discussion of the quality of the evidence. Instead the audience is left with a very powerful image of an otherwise healthy 43-year-old man suffering a stroke while driving, nearly killing himself in a subsequent car crash, being treated by surgery, and being fully restored to a normal life. His experience is certainly remarkable, but the audience is given the false impression that it is representative of everyone who has undergone the procedure or might in the future. Patient stories are powerful, which is why news outlets should choose them carefully when reporting on medical treatments. The impression left with readers is that miracle-like recoveries are commonplace with this procedure. But as we discuss in more detail below, this procedure is indicated for only a very small number of patients. Since the story chose to focus on one of these relatively rare patients, we think it was crucial to provide some broader context. How many patients are eligible for such treatment? How often are they treated within the 2.5-hour window associated with the best odds of a full recovery?","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"10295","claim":"People With Mild Cognitive Impairment Should Exercise Twice a Week, Research Says","explanation":"This brief article in U.S. News & World Report discusses recently published professional guidelines for treating a condition of aging known as \u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d (MCI) with regular moderate exercise. As the article itself notes, scientists and physicians \u201cgush\u201d endlessly about the benefits of exercise for seemingly everything, and now for MCI. However, the story didn\u2019t make it clear that this recommendation is based upon just two studies, both short-term. Nor did it give us a sense of the scope of the benefits. Does exercise help a little? A lot? The rapidly growing numbers of people diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia are clearly causes for genuine concern and even alarm in the United States. Beyond the human costs are the financial burdens on families and the overall health care system. And the persistent failure of hoped-for benefits from clinical trials of\u00a0 drugs has added to the drumbeat of worry. As a consequence, those with symptoms of MCI (which may or may not be linked to the onset of actual AD or dementia), may turn to \u201calternative\u201d interventions such as diets and dietary supplements, \u201cbrain training\u201d with crossword puzzles, and exercise. Because exercise has been demonstrated to have specific and non-specific physical and psychological benefits for many people, it\u2019s no surprise at all that guidelines from a respected journal suggesting that moderate regular exercise can improve memory would be of interest. But when the ability to summarize the precise impact of exercise is muted at best; and when the potential exists for \u201cvictim blaming\u201d among those who fail to exercise, journalists should take great care in promoting such guidelines.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"11034","claim":"Constant migraines may be from an unlikely culprit: a deviated septum","explanation":"This story advances the claims of a book author\/ear, nose\u00a0and\u00a0throat surgeon who says that many patients with migraines actually suffer from migraine-like headaches caused by a deviated\u00a0septum in the nose. While the idea sounds reasonable enough, what\u2019s lacking here is evidence. Most problematic is that the\u00a0story unquestioningly\u00a0passes\u00a0along the author\u2019s\u00a0claim \u2014 based entirely on his own\u00a0practice data \u2014\u00a0that he has a\u00a090% success rate when treating headache patients with deviated septums. That\u2019s a statistic that will probably help sell lots of books and drive more patients to the author\u2019s practice, but we doubt it accurately reflects the benefits that the typical patient can expect from this treatment. Also\u00a0troubling is the story\u2019s failure to mention any possible harms associated with the surgery promoted in the book. Considering that septoplasty itself can provoke\u00a0new chronic pain in\u00a0some patients,\u00a0this\u00a0omission\u00a0is particularly glaring. Migraine headaches\u00a0can have a huge impact on people who suffer with them and\u00a0 these patients\u00a0may seek out multiple treatments in the hope\u00a0of finding\u00a0some relief. When evaluating these therapies, journalists need to go beyond sources who stand to gain financially from promoting them, including\u00a0book authors. The most important question to keep in mind is: Where is the evidence that they work?","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":"10963","claim":"Botox use on migraines gains support","explanation":"Botox, or Botulinum Toxin Type A is typically regarded as a way to\u00a0reduce fine lines and wrinkles. However, it is increasingly being used to treat disorders related to overactive muscles\u00a0and twiching because of the temporary muscle\u00a0paralysis that Botox causes. This story reports on a news release by Allergan, the manufacturer of Botox,\u00a0about the results of a new study looking at Botox as a preventive measure for chronic migraine sufferers. This story does a commendable job outlining the evidence to support Botox use for this indication. It rightly points out that there are serious questions about the\u00a0methodology and that the details of the study have not been made available. Furthermore, it accurately describes the availability and\u00a0novelty of Botox and is careful to quote multiple, independent experts who provide valuable perspective. The story could have been improved by describing the costs of Botox injections,\u00a0and mentioning possible harms or side effects and the alternative treatment options, of which there are many.

{"claim_id":"9092","claim":"New research to treat acute malnutrition","explanation":"This news release describes a study published in\u00a0PLOS Medicine, showing that among moderate acute malnourished infants lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS)\u2013a kind of fortified peanut butter\u2013produced more gain in muscle and organ weight over 12 weeks than a corn-soy blend (CSB) porridge. Acute malnutrition affects over 50 million children across the world. It is characterized by bodily wasting following experience of a recent period of starvation. According to the researchers, until now there has been concern that because LNS has a very high fat content any weight gain it produced would be composed primarily of fat. The distinction of this study is its demonstration that LNS not only resulted in more weight gain, but that weight gain was in muscles and organs (lean mass) rather than fat. Children with the most severe level of acute malnutrition are at risk of death. Increasing the effectiveness of interventions with children before their malnutrition becomes severe could save millions of lives. However, readers would take away a better understanding of this critical issue if more space in this news release had been devoted to explaining the study itself, and less to citing various researchers and partners about how important the project was.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"9272","claim":"Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers","explanation":"This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma. It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study. And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says more than 22 million Americans have asthma, including about 6 million children. There are many more millions with the condition worldwide. A daily pill that might alleviate serious symptoms of the disease, or even prevent asthma attacks, would be a boon to public health, especially considering some of the shortcomings of other current treatments. New medications to treat the underlying problem, namely airway inflammation, are needed and would translate into improved health for this very common and sometimes serious medical problem. This release may have helped spawn two news stories that we also reviewed that had glaringly different story framing. One was by Reuters and the other by Medical Daily.

{"claim_id":"9100","claim":"New recommendations for managing menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors","explanation":"This news release lists several non-pharmalogical steps for relieving menopausal symptoms of women who have been treated for breast cancer. The main takeaway is that most women who have been treated for breast cancer shouldn\u2019t receive hormone therapy, but instead focus on lifestyle changes although some emerging pharmacologic approaches were listed as well. It\u2019s not clear from either the news release or the published study how researchers drew their conclusions. The release states that clinical trials, observational studies, guidelines, and expert opinion were analyzed, but no study data is provided to put the findings in perspective. Women who are dealing with premature menopause as a result of breast cancer treatment would benefit from a better understanding of risks and benefits of treatments. The news release states that there are 9.3 million breast cancer survivors worldwide but doesn\u2019t note, as the study does, that 43 percent of these are older than 65 at diagnosis and thus would not have menopausal symptoms due to chemotherapy for their breast cancer. The study also notes that 25 percent of those diagnosed are below age 50 and are thus more likely to be pre-menopausal at diagnosis.

{"claim_id":"9665","claim":"This New Blood Test Could Detect Concussions","explanation":"This brief story discusses a new study published in JAMA Neurology about blood tests for two biomarkers that may assist in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries among patients brought to a level-one trauma unit. The story was careful not to exaggerate the potential of the blood markers in assessing the severity of concussions. (Note: See our separate review of the news release here:\u00a0Another \u2018simple blood test\u2019 for concussion PR release over-promises) However, it missed the mark in some important ways: It didn\u2019t tell us how these biomarkers fared on accuracy, and it lacked\u00a0independent sources, such as\u00a0a brain injury or concussion expert who wasn\u2019t connected to the research. We saw some of the same limitations in\u00a0another story\u00a0we reviewed\u00a0about the use of flashcards in detecting brain injury. If a simple blood test can accurately predict traumatic brain injury, then\u00a0patients may be spared the effects of radiation from a diagnostic CT scan, and clinicians\u2013 including ambulance and emergency room attendants\u2013might have a more rapid and affordable diagnostic tool in assessing patients. However, a lot more research is needed to know if this is the case. These individuals had enough of an injury to be treated at\u00a0a level one trauma center. As such, the study may not be able to answer whether the test can be used in the majority of cases, which involve milder injuries. And these results were only applicable to adults, even though the story references drawbacks of CT scans for kids, implying these blood tests could be used for children, too.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":"9299","claim":"New Data Shows Irreversible Electroporation Nearly Doubles Overall Survival of Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer When Added to Standard Therapy","explanation":"A futuristic-sounding medical treatment is paired with a bold claim of survival benefit in this news release. But the release is missing basic\u00a0information to back up the headline\u2019s claims and put the treatment\u2019s efficacy into perspective. And an important conflict of interest is not disclosed. Such omissions could help instill false\u00a0hope in sufferers of pancreatic cancer and their families. [Editor\u2019s note: At the top of this review, we\u2019ve left blank the area where we\u2019d normally put the logo for the organization that issued this new release. This reflects our uncertainty as to who should be considered the source of this news. As we\u2019ve discussed in a blog post, the release is worded to suggest that it originated with the University of Louisville, and it includes a University of Louisville media contact. However, that contact has told us, via email and a comment on this review, that the release originated with MCS Healthcare Public Relations, which was working with a member of the University of Louisville faculty. That faculty member, in turn, suggested to us that the release was in fact cleared and sanctioned by the University. The University of Louisville media contact has refused to provide any further clarification. We\u2019re unsure whom to believe, so we\u2019ve deliberately left blank the area where we\u2019d normally indicate the news release source. The fact that we can\u2019t even tell where this news came from should raise questions about the process that produced it.] Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive\u00a0forms of cancer, killing nearly three-quarters of victims within\u00a0a year of diagnosis and about 94 percent within five years. One reason, according to the CDC, is that\u00a0nearly 80 percent of patients are diagnosed too late for\u00a0surgery (which can extend median survival by about 10 months). Thus any treatment shown to be effective in treating the disease\u2013especially a minimally invasive, non-surgical\u00a0method\u2013could possibly reduce patients\u2019 suffering and\u00a0provide them significantly more quality time with their loved ones.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"8963","claim":"Testosterone replacement therapy may slow the progression of COPD","explanation":"This release summarizes an observational study noting a relationship with two groups of men (middle aged and older), their consumption of testosterone replacement therapy and whether they are hospitalized for respiratory problems. It found that testosterone replacement therapy users had a decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users. While observational studies such as these are useful and hypothesis generating, they do not have the strength of a randomized, blinded trial and hence one cannot conclude that such associations are causal. Better information about the harms, costs and conflicts of interests of the researchers would have made this a better news release. If testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) slows the progression of COPD in men by producing a positive lung function, this could indeed be a public health advance. Observational studies, however, are problematic in that the two cohorts of men observed (those who take TRT and those who don\u2019t) may be different in other fundamental ways. There could, for example, be a \u201chealthy user bias\u201d in that the TRT cohort of men may be naturally healthier at the start, and that any improvements in COPD function may just be a function of their basic overall health. Studies like these allow us to draw conclusions,\u00a0but only that there is an association \u2014 not that TRT caused a reduction in COPD.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":"11456","claim":"Bipolar Treatment Comes Into Question","explanation":"The story reports recent evidence that anti-depressants given in conjunction with mood stabilizing drugs (such as lithium) do not significantly improve depression or exacerbate mania in bipolar patients. The story suggests that anti-depressants are over-prescribed to patients with bipolar disorder; therefore, there is a suggestion that less treatment with anti-depressants\u00a0is better. The story appropriately describes the design and some of the quantitative results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study conducted by The Systemic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The story includes information from an author of the study, as well as from a researcher not involved in the study, but who specializes in bipolar treatment. The story\u00a0notes that the study was sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health. The story mentions the potential harm of triggering a manic episode and reports (accurately) that there was no observed difference. The story could have gone further and discussed common harms from antidepressants stacked up against this finding of no benefit \u2013 strong incentive to stop giving antidepressant to\u00a0bipolar disorder.

It makes no mention of the financial ties between the researchers and insulin pump manufacturers, even though the researchers\u2019 published conflict of interest disclosure summary was substantially longer than the news story itself.

{"claim_id":"9751","claim":"Testing for more breast cancer genes offers useful information","explanation":"This story does a nice job of describing a recent study that looked at the clinical validity of several cancer genetic test panels. The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1\/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors\u2019 reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context \u2014 explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn\u2019t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1\/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations \u201cclinically actionable\u201d? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the \u201canalytical validity\u201d of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the \u201cclinical validity\u201d of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":"12625","claim":"Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes.
