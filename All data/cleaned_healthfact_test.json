{"claim_id":9271,"claim":"Treating at the Earliest Sign of MS May Offer Long-Term Benefit","explanation":"This release summarizes a study that followed 11-year treatment outcomes of two groups of patients with early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). All of the patients had experienced a first episode suggestive of MS, called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan suggesting MS. Up to 85 percent of people with CIS go on to develop MS. The two patient groups were randomized to either receive interferon beta-1 by injection immediately or receive a placebo for two years. After two years, the placebo group could receive their treatment of choice. The patients who received the drug immediately appeared to have fewer relapses over the 11 years of study, according to the lead author, but no advantages were observed in other patient outcomes such as overall disability and MRI scans. The release would have been stronger if it provided more context for judging the reduced number of relapses, especially in light of the two groups showing no difference in disability. The release also omitted mention of significant potential conflicts of interest, the high annual cost of interferon beta-1 and the drug\u2019s side effects. Society faces tough questions because of the high prices of drugs that target the immune system, such as interferon beta-1b for multiple sclerosis. This news release suggests drug therapy should begin sooner for patients without including any of the controversy on cost playing out in the United States and Europe. Last year authors of a different research study, also published in Neurology, called the rise in MS drug prices \u201calarming\u201d and wrote it was also puzzling, since some of the drugs are not new. \u201cWhy the costs of MS DMTs [disease modifying therapies] in the United States have risen so dramatically is uncertain. However, the simplest explanation is that pharmaceutical companies raise prices of new and old MS DMTs in the United States to increase profits and our health care system puts no limits on these increases,\u2019 they wrote. Why is cost so important to mention? This drug study, in particular, has significant potential conflicts of interest, discussed below under the Funding Sources & Conflict of Interest Disclosure criteria.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Millions of readers worldwide were guaranteed to have seen the charity\u2019s slogan about how stem cells can \u201cmend broken hearts\u201d right in the headline and lead of the story. Even the campaign\u2019s mascot \u2014 the zebrafish \u2014 makes an appearance. What they did not see was any challenge to the extravagant claims made about cardiac cell regeneration, any discussion of the undoubtedly sky-high costs that would be associated with stem cell treatments, or any analysis by independent experts of the quality of the evidence supporting this line of research. Just about 1 in every 50 Americans has heart failure with about 400,000 diagnosed every year. The prevalence increases with age and the number of people with it will rise as a result of increased life expectancy. Heart failure symptoms can be managed with drugs and, in extreme cases, dysfunction can be helped with implantable assistive devices. But there is no cure. So, the announcement by the British Heart Foundation to raise and spend $80 million on research into cardiac cell regeneration is important and newsworthy. Stem cell therapy, gene therapy, nanotechnology and numerous other futuristic sounding medical treatments are beloved by researchers and health writers alike, and there are promising lines of inquiry to be pursued. The trouble comes when writers attempt to translate the very difficult, complicated and sometimes frustrating scientific process for a general readership. Instead of taking a very long view and writing about these treatments as one of many possibilities for how heart medicine might evolve in the future, stories like this one present the treatments as being tantalizingly available \u201cwithin the next decade.\u201d","label":"false"}

Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame.

{"claim_id":10667,"claim":"Artificial Pancreas Continues to Show Promise","explanation":"Not only does this story neglect to provide any caveats regarding research abstracts presented at conferences, it omits the number of subjects in the study. One of the most important pieces of context for this study was that it only had 12 subjects. That needed to be in the article. In general, the term \"artifical pancreas\" builds unrealistic hope\u00a0for this technology\u00a0for patients, and some balance and caution would\u2019ve enriched the optimism with realism, doing a greater service to those with diabetes who are very interested in this topic. This story matters because hypoglycemia is dangerous and self-monitoring combined with use of insulin requires a patient to be an engaged and knowledgeable self-manager. The hope of this technology is that it would function more like a normal pancreas. But that\u2019s it\u2019s hope. Although the story provides little information about the risks and benefits observed in this small pilot study, it implies that it\u2019s almost ready for prime-time, despite late hints at the end of the article that the technology is not there yet. The discussion of the Ritholz research on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) compliance is somewhat disconnected and only loosely germane to the artificial pancreas. Research on CGM, which is approved and in use,\u00a0has clinical relevance unrelated to the investigational \"artificial pancreases,\" of which it\u2019s a component. We can only assume this study was covered in the article because it was discussed on the teleconference call that was a source of information for the story.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10690,"claim":"Treating First Time Shoulder Dislocations with Surgery Can Benefit Young Athletes, Study Shows","explanation":"This news release describes the results of a study presented at an annual meeting showing that athletes who dislocated their shoulders for the first time and underwent surgery had lower rates of postoperative instability and re-operation when compared with patients who had recurrent dislocations before undergoing surgery. It contains lots of numbers, which we applaud. These numbers are important because they add to the limited database available to help guide treatment for athletes who have suffered a shoulder dislocation. As one study put it in 2014, \u201cthere is no consensus on the optimal treatment of in-season athletes with anterior shoulder instability, and limited data are available to guide return to play.\u201d But, in stating a causal relationship, the news release goes beyond what the data support. Specifically, the news release says that the study \u201cdemonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.\u201d The study, which was observational in nature, can only show associations between shoulder surgery and subsequent outcomes \u2014 not that surgery after a first-time dislocation was the cause of reduced risks. Also missing from the release: harms, alternative therapies, costs and study limitations. This matters because, in the 2014 prospective study, just 27% of athletes whose shoulders were made unstable due to injury \u201creturned to play and completed the season without subsequent instability.\u201d According to the study\u00a0abstract, the shoulder is the most common joint dislocation, affecting 2% of the general population, most of them males. And there\u2019s a 50% likelihood of another dislocation after a first one, according to the background into given by the study authors. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, there were some 63 million visits to non-federally employed, office-based physicians specializing in orthopedic surgery in the United States in 2010. Shoulder symptoms ranked among the top four reasons given by patients for visiting orthopedic surgeons.","label":"false"}

The study cited was published in a top journal and could represent a meaningful step on the way toward innovative treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

That\u2019s what this story does. Over 20 million Americans currently take statin drugs. Anacetrapib works on cholesterol in a different way, by inhibiting a protein called CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein). These drugs also offer hope to drug companies that are losing patent protection on the leading brands of statins. That marketing angle means journalists need to be vigilant about claims of benefits. The early tests of an earlier CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, also indicated powerful effects on cholesterol, especially in raising levels of the \u201cgood\u201d HDL form. However, as this story notes, larger trials then discovered dangerous side effects. It turned out that drug actually caused more heart problems than it prevented. In reality it takes a lot of subjects to even begin to get a picture of the risks and benefits of a new drug. While encouraging, the results of this study are far from conclusive.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":8959,"claim":"Too many people missing out on health benefits of golf, says expert panel","explanation":"This news release touting the health benefits of golf overreaches and employs unjustified language in summarizing the consensus statement of 25 experts who used questionnaires to agree upon \u201chow best to maximize [golf\u2019s] health benefits, promote [its] sustainability, and widen participation.\u201d There is no original research here. The methodology used to reach a subjective consensus is fraught with major limitations which preclude making health recommendations. The news release fails to mention the entire process was funded by the World Golf Foundation, and some of the authors have other notable financial conflicts of interest within the golf industry. If a news release is going to make claims of evidence showing wide-ranging health benefits related to both physical and mental health \u2014 as well as longevity \u2014 it had best back that up with real evidence. Furthermore, when there is no original research involved, and the conflicts of interest are substantial, use of the term \u201cevidence\u201d is grossly misleading.

{"claim_id":9255,"claim":"FDA Approves Bayer's Kyleena\u2122 (Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System) 19.5 mg for Prevention of Pregnancy for up to Five Years","explanation":"The news release focuses on a forthcoming birth control product called Kyleena. The product is implanted in the uterus\u00a0and releases the hormone levonorgestrel, which the release says can prevent pregnancy for up to five years. The release does a fair job of describing the clinical trial that led to FDA\u2019s approval of Kyleena, and also addresses potential side effects associated with the product. However, the release does not address cost at all. The release also fails to discuss similar alternatives that are already on the market, or even offer any information comparing the effectiveness of Kyleena relative to other forms of birth control. [Editor\u2019s note: Bayer makes a number of IUD contraceptive devices including Mirena and a permanent contraceptive called Essure. This release stacks up favorably to a Bayer news release on Essure which we also reviewed (and discussed in a blog post) in terms of discussing harms, quantified benefits and quality of evidence. However, neither release addressed costs.] According to the CDC, more than 7 percent of U.S. women use long-term, reversible contraceptives \u2014 i.e., intrauterine systems or implants \u2014 to avoid unwanted pregnancy. The widespread use of these technologies means that they are both economically important and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 that such birth control systems have a significant impact on the health and well-being of millions of women. As such, it is newsworthy when new products receive FDA approval and come to market. But in order for potential users \u2014 and their healthcare providers \u2014 to make sense of a new product, they need some basic information. For example, they need to know how the new product compares to existing products on the market \u2014 and how much they will cost. This release falls short on both of those fronts.","label":"true"}

That means women could not have an abortion about\u00a0two weeks earlier than before. The only stated exception was to save the woman's life. However, the previous law didn\u2019t expressly include those exceptions either, though it had broad language that could potentially have been used to seek abortion for a rape or incest survivor in the third trimester.

{"claim_id":9614,"claim":"Expert Panel Reaffirms Need for Colon Cancer Screen Beginning at Age 50","explanation":"This story about updated colon cancer screening recommendations offers readers a reasonably faithful summary of the key conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The key point of the new guidelines is that several methods of screening all work pretty well for people ages 50-to-75, yet many Americans don\u2019t get screened. Unfortunately, the article doesn\u2019t do much to inform\u00a0the reader beyond the task force\u2019s news release (available for download here), only stating that \u201cthere are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations.\u201d While it may be cumbersome to explain those benefits and risks in detail, it still\u00a0would have been useful to go over some of the specifics, such as\u00a0risks and costs, so that people get a basic idea of some of the complex trade-offs at hand. While cancer screening doesn\u2019t always produce clear benefits, the USPSTF concludes colon cancer screening does offer substantial benefits for most people between the ages of 50 and 75.

{"claim_id":10970,"claim":"To reverse damage of sitting, take a brisk, hour-long walk","explanation":"This story reports on a large meta-analysis of observational studies looking at the association between sedentary behavior (sitting and TV-watching), exercise, and risk of dying prematurely. Its main take-home message is \u201cit takes about 60 to 75 minutes of \u2018moderate intensity\u2019 exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day.\u201d Although that\u2019s a faithful account of how the study researchers frame their results, we think it\u2019s likely to leave readers with a misleading impression. Despite what the researchers may claim, this type of study can\u2019t prove that exercise can \u201cundo the damage of sitting\u201d \u2014 all it can do is show associations between these behaviors and risk of death. There are many factors, other than exercise and sedentary behavior, that affect one\u2019s risk of death (e.g. diet, illnesses, socioeconomic factors), and the story didn\u2019t explain that researchers can\u2019t account for all of those factors in a study like this. Suggesting that exercise \u201creverses\u201d the damage of sitting implies a certainty to the study\u2019s conclusions that simply doesn\u2019t exist. Every day, readers are bombarded with health news messages from observational studies such as this one relating to diet, exercise, and other lifestyle issues. Because this type of research is not definitive, it is liable to be contradicted by the next study that comes along, which in turn generates a new set of headlines that is in conflict with what readers just heard from the last study. This generates confusion among the public and mistrust of both scientists and journalists who can\u2019t seem to get their stories straight.

{"claim_id":8958,"claim":"Weight loss can be boosted fivefold thanks to novel mental imagery technique","explanation":"The news release focuses on a study reporting that overweight individuals who engaged in functional imagery training (FIT) were more successful at losing weight than individuals who engaged in a type of talk therapy called motivational interviewing (MI). However, the release does not answer many questions that are relevant to determining how useful FIT is for weight loss. For example, because the study does not appear to have collected information on diet or exercise, it\u2019s not clear whether the difference in outcomes stems from differences in lifestyle choices made by study participants. It would have been helpful if the release (and study) had analyzed specifically how increased motivation and lifestyle choices can result in weight loss. The published study notes that data relating to \u201cparticipants\u2019 experiences and process variables, including frequency of motivational cognitions, self-efficacy for diet and physical activity, self-reported diet and physical activity\u201d were collected but that the results would be reported separately. When comparing the efficacy of MI and FIT, it\u2019s important to know what sort of lifestyle changes study participants made. If a significant percentage of participants who engaged in FIT also joined a for-profit diet program, that support system might explain the differing results. By the same token, it\u2019s not clear if the MI group and the FIT group were matched for initial weight, sex or age \u2014 any of which could influence how much weight was lost. Without knowledge of those details, it is difficult or impossible to say how much more effective FIT was than MI (if at all). According to the published research, there were some differences in full-time employment and the range in baseline weight that weren\u2019t addressed in the limitations section of the study and which could affect the reliability of the data.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Not a single study has raised a red flag for any birth defect and certainly not microcephaly.

The issue discussed here is clearly not one of draft evasion, and the matter of who is justified in criticizing whom for not serving in Vietnam is a gray area to be hashed out in the public arena.

She voted against amendments to ban the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. In theory, advocates believe that the amendment -- which passed late in 2014 after multiple attempts -- prevents the feds from going after sick marijuana users in states that allow medical marijuana. However, even before the amendment passed, dying patients who simply smoked joints that they obtained legally were not being hauled off to prison en masse by federal agents. Instead, the federal government focused on major suppliers or distributors. Saying Wasserman Schultz voted to send people to prison significantly exaggerates the issue. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11399,"claim":"Blood Test May Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis","explanation":"There has been recognition that RA results in gradual, cumulative destruction of joints and other parts of the body. Since we now have powerful treatment options, there has been a push to begin using them earlier. However, it\u2019s harder to identify RA in its early stages, when diagnostic techniques such as RF testing aren\u2019t as helpful. Therefore, there is a need for new diagnostic techniques for the identification of patients with joint problems in the early stages of RA. That\u2019s the context, and the social problem, described in the article. The study in question, however, is a little different. It\u2019s about understanding the processes that lead to RA and techniques that may, in the future, lead to a test for patients who may develop RA in the future. There is no\u00a0available\u00a0evidence that treatment can stave off RA in patients who don\u2019t have symptoms yet. We would have liked to have seen the article use additional sources besides the\u00a0press release. Where it does not rely on the press release, it seems to stray too far. The article claims that the investigators \"say the finding paves the way for developing a blood test for early diagnosis of the mysterious disease.\" We don\u2019t believe they said that, neither in the\u00a0published study\u00a0nor even the\u00a0press release. The authors say the technique could help identify people at risk for developing RA in the future \u2014 people who are not yet patients \u2014 as opposed to patients who have an early stage of the disease. Contrary to the article\u2019s headline, the study in question did not assess a blood test for RA, and there is no blood test now. After the headline, the story really never improved.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9673,"claim":"'Female Viagra' gets mixed reviews","explanation":"This story reports the results of a review of the new drug for female sexual dysfunction, flibanserin (Addyi). This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis studying the impact of flibanserin in women with HSDD. The CNN coverage of this large and exhaustive study had many shortcomings starting with the headline. It is hardly a \u2018mixed\u2019 review when you compare a\u00a0weighty study that found very marginal effects of the drug in nearly\u00a06,000 women, and put that up against a single compelling anecdote of a women who says her life was turned around by the drug. It\u2019s also questionable to give so much weight to the comments of a clinician with known ties to pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for female sexual problems (and without disclosing those relationships). This is an important piece of reporting because how a new\u00a0drug performs in clinical studies on thousands of patients has a direct relevance to the women who would be encouraged to take the drug and the physicians who would want to prescribe it. Journalists need to be ultra cautious in reporting on such a \u2018sexy\u2019 topic and carefully weigh the comments of clinicians and patients who provide what seem to be \u2018market-tested\u2019 testimonials. Almost everything about the marketing and medicalization of female sexual dysfunction is controversial: the article acknowledges that controversy, but barely. Most thoughtful clinicians in this area see the problem as a multifactorial one, which may be affected by physiological changes, psychological issues, relationship factors, and\/or cultural context. Any journalist weighing in on this subject must, even briefly, step back and ask: Given all these controversies, how can this study be covered in a way that\u00a0readers, especially women, aren\u2019t misled?","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10748,"claim":"Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation","explanation":"A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy \u201cbiologic\u201d drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in \u201csevere adverse events\u201d and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body\u2019s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":8970,"claim":"Blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester","explanation":"This release accurately describes an observational study using second-hand data\u00a0from another\u00a0study\u00a0\u00a0which found that a relatively inexpensive blood test (HbA1c or A1C for short), commonly used to monitor diabetes, might help identify women at risk for getting gestational diabetes as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. The release does a good job of explaining that the disorder carries risks \u2014 including the development of adult type 2 diabetes long after birth \u2014 for both pregnant women and their newborns. The release notes that the study does not scientifically demonstrate that measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy can in fact determine a woman\u2019s later risk for gestational diabetes. On the down side, the release doesn\u2019t mention what it would cost in dollars or potential over treatment to screen every women in the early weeks of pregnancy;\u00a0 offers no information about the overall prevalence and incidence of gestational diabetes or any details about the women whose records were studied; and waits until the last sentence to note that there also is no firm evidence that lowering HbA1c levels with diet and exercise before or in early pregnancy will actually reduce risk for gestational diabetes. Public health and obstetrical associations estimate that 1 to 15% of all pregnant women in the U.S. develop gestational diabetes and no doubt a greater percentage worries they might. There are potentially serious health consequences to gestational diabetes for mother and child and although some mothers at higher than usual risk \u2014 for example, women with obesity \u2014 are screened early, most women have a screening blood glucose test later in pregnancy. Glucose and insulin levels are complicated to interpret later in pregnancy. The notion that earlier detection with a test that measures average \u00a0glucose levels over time might lead to lowered rates of the disorder is seductive. But it\u2019s also true that such a scenario is only speculation at this time. As a consequence, news releases about this topic are of fairly wide interest, but must be careful not to over promise.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11438,"claim":"Glaxo Touts Experimental Tykerb As Effective Breast-Cancer Treament","explanation":"The story discusses the preliminary results of lapatinib (trade name Tykerb) and chemotherapy in HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients. Patients who took lapatinib and the chemotherapy drug Xeloda remained stable (i.e. cancer did not spread further) nearly twice as long as patients who only had chemotherapy (8.5 months vs. 4.5 months). However, many drugs are effective in prolonging response in metastatic disease without impacting length of life. It would be good to get survival data to back up these claims, or at least provide data on quality of life to see whether the addition of lapatinib made a difference and how much. Additionally, the results of this trial have not been scrutinized in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The story provides a powerful, but premature suggestion of equivalence between Herceptin and lapatinib. The suggeston is not evidenced based, as the two drugs have not been compared in a controlled trial. Potential cardiac side effects are a big issue for early-stage breast cancer patients, the group of women for whom this drug is already being tested as an alternative to Herceptin, so further research comparing the two drugs is needed. This story relies solely on sources associated with the drug manufacturer. It also appears to rely heavily on information from a press release by the study sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline. Other oncology researchers are needed for perspective on the results of lapatinib as part of treatment for HER-2 positive cancer. The story mentions that lapatinib is still being tested in clinical trials and is not yet available for sale. The story says that \u201cGlaxoSmithKline plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe by the end of this year,\u201d and later mentions Glaxo\u2019s \u201chigh hopes for Tykerb.\u201d It would have been better to get some other perspectives about these prospects, other than comments from the company or company-sponsored researchers.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9691,"claim":"New breast cancer screening guidelines at odds with Congress","explanation":"The story provides a good overview of new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on when, and how often, women should receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer. The story summarizes the long-running debate over mammogram recommendations, particularly congressional action on the issue. The story also discusses the differing advice that various organizations provide on when women at average risk of breast cancer should begin mammogram screening, though the story would have been stronger if it had more fully explored both the benefits and potential harms associated with women starting mammogram screening early or having the tests more often (something that a competing\u00a0New York Times story on the recommendations does well). The story also offers a good discussion of issues related to what the USPSTF recommendations may mean for insurance coverage of mammograms, though it does not tell readers how expensive mammograms may be without insurance. Breast cancer screening is a big deal. As the CDC notes, \u201cNot counting some kinds of skin cancer, breast cancer in the United States is the most common cancer in women, no matter your race or ethnicity.\u201d In 2012 alone, 41,150 women died of the disease. Breast cancer also has a profound impact on the economy, with researchers estimating that it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year. In other words, it affects the health and well-being of millions of patients and their loved ones, as well as having an adverse impact on the economy. News that relates to the early detection and treatment of breast cancer is clearly news worth covering, particularly when it could inform the decision-making of women and health professionals \u2014 and have an effect on women\u2019s access to screening.","label":"true"}

Combining the information for these treatments is a bit confusing. The news about XL184 reflected results which at that point had not yet been presented at a cancer conference in Berlin. While indicating that it is too early to say whether XL184 actually affects the cancer, the story should have reminded readers of the importance of things like quality of life and survival time. And there isn\u2019t evidence about those factors yet with XL184. At issue is that, while advanced prostate cancer is a challenge, not all men with advanced prostate cancer would benefit from Provenge, though the story neglected this. And it is not clear that XL184 is of benefit to anyone. News about results from a\u00a0small study that is still ongoing cannot carry enough caveats. It is really too early to know whether XL184 really shows promise or not. It is bad enough when journalists write glowing stories based on reports from scientific meetings.

For reasons that we don\u2019t understand, the story only reports on 20 of the 99 men enrolled in the study and only reports on the more positive results (those related to bone scans).

There\u2019s a lesson in this story for journalists to do a better job checking conflicts of interests in sources.

{"claim_id":8942,"claim":"Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica","explanation":"The main problems with this news release promoting an abstract from a radiology meeting are that it fails to mention the research is unpublished, and there are significant limitations which may well preclude a headline such as: \u201cPulsed Radiofrequency (pRF) Relieves Acute Back Pain and Sciatica.\u201d The touted benefits of pRF (pulsed energy applied to nerve roots of the spine by a probe) noted in this study are based on difficult-to-reproduce patient questionnaires, and framed with language that makes it very difficult for readers to place in an understandable context. Although alternatives are nicely covered \u2014 benefits, costs, availability, and potential harms of the outpatient probe procedure are not. We also reviewed a HealthDay news story about the study. Both the story and news release would have been improved with more discussion about cost, benefits and harms. Chronic back pain that does not respond to conservative treatment, and sometimes includes shooting pain into the buttocks and leg (sciatica), is difficult to treat, a leading cause of disability, and poses a huge economic burden to both individuals and the health care system. Although the search for treatments that are \u201cminimally invasive\u201d are well-intentioned and much needed, this catchphrase can be quite misleading. As we\u2019ve written before, many readers erroneously equate \u201cminimally invasive\u201d with more advanced and effective, and involving fewer complications and recovery time. Rather than prey on this notion, releases should clarify if procedures touted in this way even come close to meeting such expectations. Many back patients have very straightforward questions they need answered: Do I need surgery? If not, what are my alternatives? How effective are those alternatives? What are the benefits vs. risks involved? What will it cost me? Not answering those questions clearly (or making it clear if the answers are unknown) does readers a disservice. Back pain creates tremendous personal, family and economic burdens. In the majority of individuals, the source of the pain cannot be identified, and undoubtedly there are many different causes of back pain. If the source of pain in any individual can be identified accurately, specific interventions may be able to be developed to treat that subset of patients resulting in improved quality of life for those individuals and less economic burden. But it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that in the vast majority of individuals, the pain resolves spontaneously without any residual disability.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10888,"claim":"Study Shows Limited Benefits From Calcium","explanation":"This piece reports on the outcomes from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative about the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D to prevent hip fracture. Although the results showed that the level of calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce hip fracture, they did find that this level of supplementation did increase the risk of kidney stones. There were several interesting points raised in the study that were not reported on in this story. This first is that the methods used to encourage supplement use was only adequate to get a subset of the women studied to take the supplements. The results also point out the discrepancy between the common measure of \u2018bone health\u2019 (bone density) and the outcome of importance (fracture rate). Lastly, the study also showed that women who fell were significantly more likely to have a hip fracture than those who never fell. This raises the question of whether an intervention to reduce the likelyhood of falls would be useful for reducing risk of hip fracture. The overall tone of the article is suggestive that women beyond menopause should still take these supplements, though this is not consistent with the results of the study.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Results were mixed, but the doctor-and-patient pairs who both received cash rewards showed the best results in lowering cholesterol levels.

Solving behavioral issues that prevent patients from taking their medications is an important challenge.

Many of the established Good Ideas in medicine (medications, etc) are stymied by downstream hurdles \u2014 doctors don\u2019t prescribe the treatment as often as they should, patients don\u2019t follow through, etc. Statins are a great example.

{"claim_id":9008,"claim":"Eating more fish could prevent Parkinson's disease","explanation":"The subtitle of this news release says the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) study \u201cshines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurologic health.\u201d But this in vitro lab study only suggests that the fish protein, parvalbumin, binds to a particular human protein called \u201calpha-synuclein\u201d which has been identified as forming amyloid chains in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. The news release should have made it clear that studies of fish cannot be extrapolated to humans, and further, that no cause and effect relationship has been established between amyloid proteins and the development of any neurologic disease. Any news release touching on Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2014 or any other of the neurodegenerative disorders that have no cure \u2014 is likely to draw a lot of attention from news organizations. Parkinson\u2019s disease alone affects about 1 million Americans and 10 million people worldwide. Although this news release clearly states the disease has no cure, it is riddled with language that implies fish consumption inhibits amyloid formation and that amyloid formation \u201ccan be responsible for various diseases,\u201d but that\u2019s an unproven theory and not even addressed by this study.

Following a recently published study, Jardiance is now being positioned as an add-on to standard care and a preventative therapy that reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, as well as risk of death from any cause, in patients with type 2 diabetes. The story capably lays out the basics of the study, but its reliance on relative risk figures (which may tend to inflate the magnitude of the effect), as well as the lack of any comment on potential harms, were considered significant drawbacks by our reviewers. Editor\u2019s note: We learned that Reuters made updates to the initial version of this story, including the headline, after our review was complete. Although we applaud such efforts to provide more information and context to readers, such efforts do miss readers like us who only saw the original version of the story. People with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without diabetes, according to the World Heart Association. Cardiovascular disease is also a leading cause of death among people with diabetes. An add-on therapy that can help prevent serious heart disease and fatal complications could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of people with type 2 diabetes.The CDC estimates that more than 9% of the U.S. population \u2014 or 29 million people \u2014 have type 2 diabetes.","label":"MISLEADING"}

To determine that risk, the test looks for specific pieces of RNA generated by the baby that migrate into a mother\u2019s bloodstream and which are associated with preterm deliveries. The story offers a short, readable, un-hyped, and eminently useful summary of the research, and it offers several comparisons to the standard alternative, which is an ultrasound scan. The story would have benefited from an outside expert weighing on the study and its potential ramifications and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 the potential harms of a false-positive test, which are not insignificant. According to the CDC, preterm birth affects about one in every 10 infants born in the US.

It includes good sources and makes clear that chondroitin, though not proven to be effective, is also not harmful. But the story might help the reader evaluate the evidence if it explained a little more. For example, the authors of the analysis found that the effect of chondroitin on pain was equivalent to an improvement of 0.6 millimeters on a 10-centimeter scale\u2014extremely tiny. This piece of data would have provided readers with a quantifiable estimate of non-efficacy. The story also neglects to note that there are other nonsurgical therapies that can help.

{"claim_id":10201,"claim":"Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many \u2013 report","explanation":"This story parrots a news release sent out by Oxford University about a study published in the journal BMJ Open. The study concludes\u00a0that partial knee replacements would \u2014 in many cases \u2014 leave patients \u201cbetter off\u201d than total knee replacements. With no independent reporting, the story glosses over how the study was conducted, what was measured, and what the limitations were. It also didn\u2019t discuss harms of surgery, among other problems. An over-reliance on publicity materials appears to be a pattern \u2014 last week the Guardian received a 1-star score from us for a different story that also simply restated what the news release said. Knee replacement surgeries are not uncommon. A 2015 study reported that, as of 2010, there were 4.7 million people in the U.S. who had received a total knee replacement. If partial knee replacement (also called a unicompartmental knee replacement, or UKR) is an option for many patients, and the partial version could improve outcomes and reduce medical costs, then this is a finding with the potential to significantly improve life for patients (and make U.S. insurers happier in the process). However, it\u2019s important to highlight the risks associated with such a decision \u2014 even if those risks could potentially be reduced by seeing an increase in partial replacement surgeries over time. The importance of this research is that for some people a less-invasive surgical procedure may be an option, but the choice isn\u2019t quite so clearcut as the researchers imply.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9486,"claim":"There's a promising new HIV vaccine candidate in the pipeline","explanation":"This story about an experimental HIV vaccine gets off on the wrong foot by describing the research as \u201cpromising,\u201d which we\u2019ve previously flagged as one of 7 words that shouldn\u2019t be used in medical news. Why not? As our publisher, Gary Schwitzer, wrote: \u201cThe word promising means \u2018likely to be successful\u2019 or \u2018to give a basis for expecting.\u2019 There is far too much uncertainty in medicine for this word to be applied loosely in the coverage of medicine.\u201d Despite this initial misstep, the story does quickly establish the preliminary nature of the research and cautions that it\u2019s much too soon to know if the vaccine will ultimately be effective in preventing HIV infections. It also does a nice job of putting this research in context with other HIV prevention efforts that have succeeded in slowing the spread of the disease. More attention to the possible costs of a vaccine \u2014 a huge issue for the developing world countries most affected by the virus \u2014 would have rounded out this otherwise solid effort. This new vaccine approach, if proven ultimately to be effective, safe and affordable, could make a major difference in resource-poor settings around the world. But, as we\u2019ve written about,\u00a0the field of vaccine research related to HIV is littered with huge obstacles and there are never any guarantees that drug therapies will ever be accessible to the poorest parts of the world, where the need for a vaccine might be greatest.

{"claim_id":10167,"claim":"Anti-smoking drug receives FDA approval","explanation":"This is an evening network newscast story on the recent FDA approval of the drug varenicline (trade name Chantix) for smoking cessation. Given the time constraints of this news story, the reporters do an excellent job of even-handedly presenting the new drug in the context of other therapies for smoking cessation. Varenicline may be an option for those who have not been able to quit smoking using other drug treatments, such as the anti-depressant bupropion (trade name Zyban) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the \u201csignificant improvement\u201d over existing therapies for smoking cessation; however, the long-term benefit of varenicline over exiting therapies is not very significant. Approval of varenicline was largely based on two double-blind, randomized studies of 2000 smokers in which the drug was compared with bupropion (trade name Zyban) and a placebo. The studies were both funded by Pfizer, maker of varenicline. The news story presents longer-term (1 year) abstinence rates, which are important for evaluating smoking cessation therapies. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of side effects. Nausea, headaches, insomnia and other stomach problems were more common in the varenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. The cost of a 12-week course of varenicline is provided in context with a message that smoking is a strong addiction and that reliance on a pill alone may not be enough. There is a behavioral component to smoking cessation that is recognized even by Pfizer, which, in the press release announcing approval of varenicline for smoking cessation, also announces plans to offer varenicline users an interactive on-line support program. (Publisher\u2019s Note: Although this review points out some flaws, this NBC story is to be applauded for what it achieved in the usual limited time afforded TV news stories. That same night, the ABC and CBS network newscasts ran stories on the same topic, but their stories each ran only about 15 seconds and contained little information.)","label":"MISLEADING"}

Is this the future? Fortunately for readers, this story\u00a0 did a better job than HealthDay in making better use of independent experts and didn\u2019t allowing the lead author to get away with one of the more over-the-top statements that was quoted in the HealthDay story. But it did fail to explain the harms that may be associated with widespread use of scans or with false positives, the costs, and the alternatives to this type of screening. . Autism spectrum disorders are increasingly being diagnosed, yet the causes remain elusive and the treatments are far from a cure for most kids. Parents are hungry for solutions, as can be seen in the passionate comments below this article. What we do know is that early detection appears to be important because early intervention has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of the disorder.

{"claim_id":11132,"claim":"Migraine drug could halve the length of attacks, study shows","explanation":"The Guardian covers a new phase III clinical trial of erenumab, a drug injected monthly, designed to reduce the frequency of painful migraines. The piece does a good job putting the results into context and even compares those findings to the placebo group, giving them a more transparent and helpful context. However, readers would have appreciated being told more of the basics. What are the possible side effects? How much might the drug cost? How is this different from other migraine treatments? Many news organizations used more sensational \u201cbreakthrough\u201d language than The Guardian did in this story. But this was still only half a loaf, inexplicably reporting on one migraine study in the New England Journal of Medicine without even mentioning or linking to another migraine study in the same journal with a somewhat similar antibody agent. Why? About one in four US homes and perhaps 12% of the US population (much of it female) experiences migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people each year. There\u2019s no cure-all for the severe headaches, and current treatments and preventative drugs can cause unwanted side effects like tiredness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, heart rate issues, and more. So any alternative that is both effective and safe would be good news. But, as Dr. Richard Lehman wrote on his terrific BMJ blog, \u201cthe real worry is that antibodies beget antibodies, and we don\u2019t know how long these (drugs) will remain effective or what long-term harms they might have.\u201d And The Guardian story didn\u2019t adequately address either concern.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9748,"claim":"Too Much Fat? Try a Whole-Body Scan Procedure gives far more data than a body-mass index","explanation":"A DXA body composition scan featured in the Wall Street Journal. The format of this story \u2014 with its hepful \u201cAche, Claim, Verdict\u201d structure \u2014 suggests we are going to be treated to a no-nonsense examination of the evidence supporting dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, for whole body scans to determine an individual\u2019s body composition in terms of fat, bone and muscle. However, the story doesn\u2019t deliver much more than a superficial look at the technology and is lacking in critical perspective. The story concludes that DXA is much more accurate than body mass index (BMI) at calculating someone\u2019s body composition, but doesn\u2019t give readers much information on why this may be important to their health. It focuses on the question of how often one should get scanned, and never challenges the assumption that one needs to get scanned at all. It doesn\u2019t mention that there appears to be no data to show that those who use these scans have any better outcomes than those who do not. We live in a body-conscious society. It\u2019s not clear precisely how much money people in the United States spend on weight loss. U.S. News, for example, reported in 2013 that we spend more than $60 billion a year on weight loss. A year earlier, ABC News pegged it at $20 billion. Regardless of which figure is closer to the mark, the weight loss industry is a juggernaut. And that doesn\u2019t even get into the fitness industry focused on helping us have bigger muscles or more toned bodies. In short, people are extremely interested in losing fat and gaining muscle \u2014 and DXA appears to be a tool aimed at, to paraphrase this story, taking the guesswork out of figuring out how well you\u2019re doing. It is, perhaps, inevitable that news outlets will cover this tool and its effectiveness.

{"claim_id":11265,"claim":"Women who quit hormone therapy still live with cancer risk","explanation":"This story reports on an article published\u00a0in this week\u2019s Journal of the American Medical Association. The article presents follow-up data\u00a0from\u00a0the landmark\u00a0Women\u2019s Health Initiaive\u00a0on the\u00a0risks and benefits of hormone therapy. The new data shows that at three years after stopping hormone therapy, there was no increased risk of heart disease in the hormone therapy group, however the increase in breast cancer risk did persist at three years. The story does not provide adequate details about alternatives to\u00a0hormone therapy\u00a0for menopausal symptoms or about lower-hormone options that could potentially confer less risk. The story does not quantify the risks of hormone therapy, in absolute terms or otherwise. This is particularly important for this subject because the risks involved are realtively small. For example, in the study, the risk of breast cancer was less than one half of one percent per year in the hormone therapy group. Furthermore, other than to describe the study as \"sweeping\", the story does not adequately describe the strength of the new evidence. Most importantly, the story does not explain that these findings do not necessarily apply to younger women who take hormone therapy for shorter periods of time. Overall, in focusing solely on the risks of hormone therapy, this story implies that it is not a reasonable choice for women. In reality, when taken by women who are actively experiencing symptoms for short periods of time, hormone therapy is safe and effective.","label":"true"}

Even in 2013 this assertion was not entirely correct, and now, more than three years later, we know it\u2019s not correct. Only about 60,000 people failed to re-up with Florida Blue, and there\u2019s a good chance that many of those 60,000 found coverage elsewhere -- including through the Obamacare exchanges. Indeed, in the most recent year, the Obamacare marketplace has enabled 1.7 million Floridians to sign up for coverage, a far bigger number than the losses cited in the ad.

{"claim_id":11606,"claim":"Finding cancer that mammograms can miss","explanation":"The focus of this story was a review of a newly-published study demonstrating added benefit of ultrasound in addition to mammography for women at increased risk of cancer due to dense breast tissue. The story appropriately mentions why traditional screening methods may miss an early-stage tumor in this population. It is not the usual standard to do any other screening (aside from mammogram) in women with dense breast tissue situations, except for very high-risk BRCA carriers who now get MRI as well. Ultrasound is already available, as implied in the story, and not a new method of treatment. The broadcast does not mention that physicians and ultrasonographers in the study were trained using standardized screening protocols. In a real-world clinical setting, the availability of properly training physicians and technicians can vary, resulting in greater false-negatives or false-positives. The editorial by Dr. Kulk accompanying the JAMA source article states, \"It is questionable whether the diagnostic accuracy achieved in the study..would have been the same if nonradiologists had performed screening ultrasound.\" The story could have mentioned this. In addition, the story didn\u2019t discuss costs, didn\u2019t explain why this study was \"the most definitive so far,\" and didn\u2019t explain benefits in absolute terms which are probably most helpful to most viewers. Importantly, the story mentions that screening may need to be tailored to a woman\u2019s individual risk profile, as well as her preferred screening schedule based on an assessment of risks and benefits.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The other eight were exposed to 60 minutes of continuous bright light. Those who experienced the flashing light were more quickly able to alter their circadian clock and thus, in theory, more quickly adapt to a new time zone. The report covered the main bases found in the published research and, unlike a CNN article on the same study, included the helpful commentary of an outside observer who was able to add context to the meaning and impact of the study. Jet lag is a significant concern for many people who have to travel distances that span\u00a0multiple time zones, where their\u00a0ability to work effectively is compromised as the body struggles to adjust to a\u00a0new time zone. This means a simple, but effective light therapy session could bring much-needed relief to those who have to travel but also, possibly, to those who do shift work and are frequently forced into combat\u00a0against the body\u2019s natural circadian rhythms.

The story went beyond the press release used to promote the study, but it needed to go much further in helping readers understand the strength of the findings and their potential impact on readers considering surgery. One of the risks associated with surgery is kidney failure, an outcome no patient or surgeon wants. To be able to reduce that risk by taking a pill would be a major boon to medicine. This study hints that statins could provide that benefit, but, as the authors themselves acknowledge, there are significant limitations to a backward-looking, uncontrolled study.

{"claim_id":9177,"claim":"New blood test may predict cardiovascular events in patients with or without coronary artery disease, research shows","explanation":"The news release reports on research suggesting that testing for plasma ceramides, a type of blood lipid, might enable doctors to identify individuals at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes even though they have healthy cholesterol levels and no evidence of coronary blockage. It provides a readable and reasonably straightforward account of what the researchers did and why it might be important, but there are a number of significant omissions. First, the release should have acknowledged that this test \u2014 even if it does effectively identify individuals at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke \u2014 may not lead to treatment that actually lowers that risk. Knowing about an increased risk doesn\u2019t mean that risk can be reduced. Many other similar risk markers have been proposed over the years and so far haven\u2019t been found very useful for actually guiding treatment that improves outcomes. Moreover, the research discussed in the release was being presented at a scientific meeting, meaning it has not yet gone through the peer-review process for publication in a journal. In addition, the news release provides no information about the costs of the new test, which appears to be available only through Mayo Medical Laboratories. It also does not discuss the possibility of false positive results, potentially leading to unnecessary treatment. Cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, kills more Americans than any other disease, including cancer. Although health experts have long advised people to try to maintain low cholesterol levels \u2013 especially for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 research suggests that as many as half of all heart attacks occur in individuals who have normal cholesterol levels. In addition, heart attacks can occur in individuals, especially women, for whom angiograms show no blockage of the coronary arteries.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11354,"claim":"Stem Cell Research: The Quest Resumes","explanation":"This is a first-rate piece of magazine journalism. The article, as much about basic stem cell science as about medical treatment, focuses on one key researcher\u2019s efforts to advance understanding of stem cells. The article puts those efforts in the context of politics, past and current research and the potential for clinical application. It personalizes the story without generating false emotion or hope. It\u2019s a strong example of how journalists can educate the public about the importance and difficulties of scientific research\u2013something that\u2019s very useful against a backdrop of so much out-of-context, misleading reporting about the benefits and dangers of drugs and treatments. It\u2019s particularly useful in an area where political interests have distorted some underlying scientific issues. The story could have been made even stronger if the author had talked to politically neutral people who for scientific reasons are less sanguine about the outcomes of stem cell research. The scientific community has endured years of having to defend the importance\u2013indeed, the legality\u2013of work with stem cells. This has resulted in a nearly united front in the field advancing the message that stem cell research is on the cusp of life-saving application and a transforming force in the history of medicine. This may turn out to be accurate. It may not. Only at the very end does the story explore the safety and efficacy issues that are important barriers to clinical application. It would have been better to have a little more of this a little earlier and to have it supplemented by an independent voice.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9889,"claim":"Old drug could cure HIV-linked dementia","explanation":"Patients with HIV may develop dementia as a result of the virus in the brain or inflammation as a result of the illness. The typical symptoms of HIV-associated dementia include short-term memory loss, slowing of thinking, difficulties with complex tasks, and social withdrawal. Neurological symptoms such as hand tremor and gait difficulties are also common. This story is about a study that tested an anti-seizure medication, valproic acid (Depakote), on cognitive functioning in 22 patients in over a 10-week period. 16 people in the study had HIV-related cognitive impairment, while 6 did not. Valproic acid is FDA approved to prevent seizures, but it is currently also used off-label for treatment of certain mental illnesses and in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as it is thought to prevent or reverse cognitive decline. The story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s description of study design and results is incomplete and there is no quantitative data presented on benefits or side effects. The study only lasted 10 weeks, and while there was a trend towards improvement, the story made no explanation of what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improvement\u00e2\u20ac\u009d means or how it was measured or in how many people it was observed. It is important that the journalist mentions the need for a larger clinical trial to replicate results. 22 people is a very small sample to suggest generalizability of the results in terms of treating HIV dementia with valproic acid, so the headline is overzealous. There is still no \u201ccure\u201d for HIV-related dementia and current non-experimental options for treating this condition are not mentioned. The story doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention side effects of taking valproic acid. The quote that it is \u201csafe and well-tolerated by this population\u201d does not provide enough information for a piece reporting the results of a published study. Also, 10 weeks is not enough time to assess long-term side effects for this medication in HIV patients. Anti-convulsant drugs like Depakote can have serious side effects when taken long term.

It is difficult to understand why a news organization would devote time and space to such a preliminary story about a controversial \"condition\" or \"diagnosis\" without even mentioning the controversies.

{"claim_id":10093,"claim":"Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test","explanation":"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study\u00a0that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms \u2014 such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess \u2014 and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it\u2019s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately\u00a0248,000 children\u00a0were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn\u2019t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child\u2019s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What\u2019s more,\u00a0the Mayo Clinic notes\u00a0that having one concussion increases the risk of a child\u2019s having a second concussion \u2014 and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children\u00a0without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it\u2019s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10438,"claim":"Panel recommends pneumonia vaccine for adult smokers","explanation":"The NY Daily News took a 750-word Associated Press story and chopped it down to 230 words. It lost much of the important meat in this cut \u2013 all to save 500 words. Our comments target this butchered Daily News version. The Daily News version cut out these important elements of the original AP story:   cost and cost-effectiveness questions; concerns that the new vaccinations may be considered overtreatment in otherwise healthy younger smokers; the only interview with an independent source; any discussion of the inefficacy of the vaccine in younger people or of the fact that there is no booster available, even though protection drops off after 5-10 years. The chief deficiencies of either version of the article\u00a0are that the\u00a0reader is left without a sense of\u00a0how\u00a0effective the vaccine might be in the newly-targeted populations. The article could have been improved with an attempt at quantification of benefits or numbers needed to vaccinate as well as with richer interviews of more disinterested experts who could have filled in these areas. Some vague areas in the article are misleading: the vaccine does not in the best of circumstances prevent lung infection; pneumococcal infection is not synonymous with \"pneumonia;\" \u00a0the vaccine may have no \"booster\" but revaccination is a common practice; and not all smokers are alike, making it unlikely that the CDC would recommend the vaccination indiscriminately. After reading the article, the reader should be left wondering what the health benefit might be of this strategy, but fairly confident that more vaccine will be sold and administered. And readers of the shortened NY Daily News article\u00a0 got even less. If 230 words is all you can invest in a story like this, you might as well give up the space to the comics section or Sudoku.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10740,"claim":"Weighing effectiveness versus risk in obesity drugs","explanation":"This story endeavors in a noble task: providing readers with an assessment of the landscape for obesity drugs. We wish more stories took this broad view when writing about new drug studies or approvals. The article does a good job of framing the key issues, asking, essentially, whether is there enough benefit to justify the side effects. Not often do stories address this issue, and we applaud their approach. The story comes close to achieving a balance in its attempt to answer this question. For example, the statements by Thomas and Wolfe are excellent alternative opinions to the views espoused by the obesity drug expert camp. But we\u00a0wish this story had gone beyond a he said\/she said look at the evidence and that it had not relied so heavily on sources that have strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry, which is pushing hard for looser restrictions on anti-obesity drug approvals. There also is some clear disease-mongering in the article, which gives it the unsavory taste while you read it. As this story notes, a third of the US adult population is obese, and the situation has only worsened in recent years, despite concerted public health efforts to address this serious public health threat. Pills, though, are just one part of the equation. From reading this story, people might believe that the only reason people are obese is because they don\u2019t have access to the right pills. How does this explain the huge contrast between the US and other developed countries in terms of obesity? How does this explain the rapid rise in average body-mass index over the past three decades and the resulting rise in diabetes, heart disease and other health problems? The story accepts as its underlying premise that obesity would melt away if drug companies could find the right pill and that they are being scared away by the big bad FDA. Even a story that is primarily focused on the drug industry and not the root causes of obesity should have given more weight to the evidence about the health problems resulting from obesity drugs.","label":"false"}

And the release offers something that can allegedly reduce that confusion: GenomeDx Biosciences\u2019 Decipher, a test that sniffs out 22 different\u00a0genetic\u00a0signals\u00a0of how\u00a0a cancer case might play out. Next we\u2019re told about the struggle between urologists and radiation oncologists. The former group is less likely than the latter to prescribe \u201cadjuvant therapy,\u201d typically radiation, after removing a prostate gland. Missing high-risk cancer cases and not treating them is a problem, of course, but so is treating men who probably don\u2019t need it. (Although we\u2019re never really told why that\u2019s an issue.) According to the release, Decipher has the ability to change the minds of both urologists (45%) and radiation oncologists (35%), and get more of them to agree what or what not to do with a patient after removal of his cancerous prostate gland. That\u2019s potentially an important advance, but we aren\u2019t provided with crucial context \u2014 notably that it\u2019s unclear if the decisions made because of Decipher were actually better decisions that would lead to a reduction in prostate cancer deaths. We\u2019re also never cautioned about the small size of the study, given cost information about the test, or told about potential harms. Among cancers in men, prostate cancer is the second-most common \u2013 about 1 in 5 men in the U.S. will get a diagnosis in their lifetimes. It\u2019s also the second-most deadly: Of the more than 200,000 men diagnosed each year in the U.S., nearly 30,000 die. (At least twice as many more black men succumb to prostate cancer as other ethnic groups.) Testing prostate cancer for how likely it is to grow quickly and migrate (metastasize) might save a lot of men from unnecessary follow-up treatments and unwanted side effects. So, a reliable tool to help clinicians make informed choices \u2013 and with a consensus of opinion among the doctors a patient sees \u2013 stands to help everyone while reducing costs associated with prostate cancer.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9623,"claim":"Program Cut Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections","explanation":"HealthDay highlights a national effort to help reduce an uncomfortable and costly problem: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and specifically those caused by indwelling catheters. These devices\u00a0are tubes that snake up the urethra into a person\u2019s bladder, are anchored there with an inflatable balloon, and continuously\u00a0drain a patient\u2019s urine. HealthDay\u00a0nicely\u00a0captures the scope of the problem, noting that one in five hospital patients are catheterized, and that, of these, 20% are bound to get a UTI. Looking at a typical year, this adds up to about 250,000 hospital-acquired UTIs and roughly $250 million in healthcare costs. The story included quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The story breaks down his team\u2019s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called \u201cStop CAUTI,\u201d which is a government-sponsored training toolkit to not only reduce indwelling catheterization rates, but also help caretakers use better technique when they have to insert the devices. The results, as HealthDay explains them? It\u2019s not clear; we\u2019re not given many quantified benefits or study details, and the results that are included happen to conflict with each other. Also missing was a discussion around limitations of the research. Indwelling catheters are very common sights at hospitals, since nurses can insert them once and they rarely slip out (a balloon at the end holds them in place). However, about 75% of UTIs are caused by such catheters, according to the CDC, and more than two-thirds of those infections are thought to be avoidable \u2014 both through better caretaker training and by avoiding the use of indwelling catheters.

The evidence of a connection is suggestive but not conclusive. Monarch populations have been declining alongside a shrinkage in its primary food source -- milkweed -- and the increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides and herbicides. However, causation has not been established yet, and other culprits -- deforestation and unexpected weather events -- are likely to have played a role as well. Moreover, DeFazio exaggerated when he said that the butterfly species is \"becoming extinct.\" It faces significant challenges, but monarchs remain several steps away from extinction, and many conservationists think the trend can be mitigated. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9396,"claim":"How barbershops could help lower blood pressure","explanation":"This well-written CNN story describes a multi-year study that looked at whether providing blood pressure screening and access to pharmacists in black-owned barber shops might be effective in reducing high blood pressure among the African-American men who patronize these establishments. The study was presented as part of the 67th annual scientific session of the American Association of Cardiologists. The story is strong and scores well because it discusses critical data from the study, offers comments from independent sources and provides information on limitations. It didn\u2019t delve into either costs or harms, but in this case, there seems to be minimal need for either, due to the nature of the research. One minor point we think the story could have made: It remains to be seen if this style of intervention ultimately leads to a reduced risk of stroke, serious heart disease, and\/or heart attacks, especially if there is not a long-term barbershop program in place. This was a unique choice for a study presented at the ACC conference. Often, the studies presented at the conference are industry-funded and focus on specific (and often very expensive) drugs or devices. We were heartened to see the news media give this study broad coverage, and found this story especially refreshing to read.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9692,"claim":"Cortisol levels in children's hair may reveal future mental health risk","explanation":"This story reports that in an\u00a0Australian study of 70 children (average age 9.5 years), those who had experienced a higher number of traumatic events also had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in samples of their hair. The researchers are hypothesizing that the\u00a0cortisol levels might be a marker of future mental health problems in the children, as people with depression and other mental health problems, as well as physical problems like diabetes, sometimes have high levels of cortisol. Here\u2019s the problem with this story: The study being reported on never actually looked at whether cortisol levels had anything to do with future mental health diagnoses. And in fact, cortisol levels were found not to be correlated with current depressive symptoms in these children. Moreover, the study had such a small sample as to make any conclusions resulting from it highly uncertain. So it\u2019s a huge stretch to claim that cortisol in hair \u201cmay reveal future mental health risk\u201d in children. We wish the story had been more cautious, especially in its headline, when discussing the implications of this very preliminary research. Childhood lays the foundation for one\u2019s health over a lifetime, so identifying people who have risk factors for health problems early on \u2014 as with a simple hair test \u2014 is an attractive idea. This might\u00a0allow for\u00a0early intervention to modify risk and get people into treatment sooner, lessening the impact of disease or behavioral problems on their lives.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10759,"claim":"Some Doctors Question New Cancer Treatment","explanation":"This story shows how \"a shortcut the Food and Drug Administration allows for granting regulatory approval to certain medical devices\" has allowed the NanoKnife, an experimental treatment with very limited evidence, to be touted as the latest cure for cancer. The story hits nearly all of our marks, although we wish there were more detail in areas such as costs, potential benefits, and the overall evaluation of the evidence. This device is the type one might see advertised on the side of a bus or in the back pages of of a weekly tabloid. Health reporters often ignore these claims to focus on the higher profile blockbuster drugs being sold by major drug companies or some breakthrough discovery in a major scientific journal. The promotion and use of these\u00a0under-researched devices\u00a0can have devastating consquences for patients. In addition, one of the major drivers of increasing health care costs is the introduction of new technologies. While additional costs may be justified if there is an improvement in patient outcomes associated with the new technology, newer is not always better. The NanoKnife is the latest in a series of new devices, approved by the FDA, that have yet to demonstrate a substantive improvement in patient outcomes.

{"claim_id":10483,"claim":"Viscosupplementation Recommended For Appropriate Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis","explanation":"This news release from the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) describes a therapy called viscosupplementation that involves injecting hyaluronic acid, a gel-like fluid, that acts as a lubricant to alleviate pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. In this case the target audience is senior citizens. Because the subhead of the release describes it as a \u201cNew Scientific Statement\u201d the ASSM might be forgiven for the medical jargon used throughout the release. This clearly wasn\u2019t written for the general public. For example, the release doesn\u2019t explain the term \u201cviscosupplementation,\u201d which is what this release is promoting. We hope health journalists take care when re-interpreting the language for the older Americans considering their many options for treating a common ailment like painful knees. The release offers no discussion on costs of viscosupplementation or insurance coverage restrictions. The benefit data is limited and there are no mention of harms. The article upon which this recommendation is based won\u2019t be published until January 2016 which makes these limitations much more critical. Osteoarthritis of the knee is the most common form of arthritis and can be seen as a normal part of aging and of \u201cwear and tear\u201d of the body. It occurs most often in people over age 50 and more often in women than in men. It\u2019s degenerative, getting worse over time. With the aging of the US population, especially considering the crush of baby boomers, the subject of how best to manage the pain and disability seen with osteoarthritis of the knee becomes important. While viscosupplementation has been available for many years, the majority of randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated a consistent or important benefit to either pain level or functionality from this therapy. A terse, vaguely worded and incomplete release does little to inform either the general public or the clinical community.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10822,"claim":"Mammograms Save Lives for Women in Their 40s, Study Says","explanation":"The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece. Perhaps largely because the story doesn\u2019t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited. The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all. While this story begins telling readers that \"Another study\u2026finds that screening can lower the risk of dying\u2026\" \u2013\u00a0 look at how other competing stories began:\u00a0  4th paragraph of AP story:\u00a0\"The new study has major limitations and cannot account for possibly big differences in the groups of women it compares.\" 1st paragraph of LA Times blog story:\u00a0 \"Critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading.\" 2nd sentence of NY Times story:\u00a0 \"Results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit.\" No such skepticism, no such independent critical evaluation took place in the HealthDay story. Women \u2013 especially in their 40s \u2013 must be terribly confused by the swirling studies. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November, the American Cancer Society and others\u2019 backlash against it, the Norwegian study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and now the new Swedish study. This is when journalism must rise to the challenge with an extraordinary effort to help evaluate evidence, ask tough questions, and offer insightful analysis.

This news release, about a phase II clinical trial of the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) for one type of anal cancer, is decidedly more down to earth. The news release refrains from hype but still falls short of the mark when it comes to describing costs, potential harms, and comparisons with existing treatments. While calling results \u201cencouraging,\u201d the news release would be more helpful if it provided a meaningful assessment of whether this therapy might advance the Moon Shot\u2019s directive of saving lives. Anal cancer is relatively rare. The American Cancer Society projects 8,080 new cases and 1,080 deaths in 2016. The number of new anal cancer cases has been rising. It is found mainly in older adults, with an average age in the early 60s. The risk of being diagnosed with anal cancer during one\u2019s lifetime is about 1 in 500, with women at slightly higher risk. Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is the most common form of anal cancer and is linked to infection by the human papilloma virus (HPV), the same virus that causes cervical cancer. The chemotherapy and radiation protocols that have been used to treat anal cancer have remained little changed since the 1970s, and there is no FDA-approved chemotherapy drug specific to anal cancer, according to the HPV and Anal Cancer Foundation. In recent years, a new class of drugs called immunotherapy drugs that unleash the body\u2019s own immune system to attack cancer have offered a potential alternative to traditional treatments for several types of cancer.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The implication of this was not clearly presented in the story, but with fewer vessels formed, if vessels become blocked, there is less capacity to provide the heart muscle with blood. So there is increased risk of heart muscle damage and death. The story neglected to present the complete array of treatment options for the management of coronary artery disease and did not provide the reader with information on the guideline criteria for the use of stents.

{"claim_id":9676,"claim":"More support for osteoporosis drugs","explanation":"This thorough, well-researched story focuses on the debate over how and whether bisphosphonates should be used to treat osteoporosis, and provides a general overview of the related risks and potential benefits. The story does many things well \u2014 and addresses cost, potential conflicts of interest, and disease mongering particularly well. However, the story cites benefit numbers from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper without giving readers any information about the study or where those numbers came from. Providing more context on those benefit numbers would have made the story stronger. Osteoporosis is not uncommon. Estimates of osteoporosis occurrence (and severity) vary, but a 2014 study estimated that more than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of bone injuries, such as hip fractures, that can have significant impacts on a patient\u2019s health and quality of life. A 2007 study estimated that 65 percent of women who develop osteoporosis, and 42 percent of men who develop osteoporosis, will suffer a bone fracture in their lifetime. In short, many people will have to make decisions about how to prevent or treat osteoporosis. If there are complicated issues surrounding widely-used treatment options \u2014 as is the case with bisphosphonates \u2014 there is real value in news stories that attempt to untangle those issues for readers. That also makes it particularly important for such stories to clearly address everything from the financial ties of expert sources to the quality of the evidence tied to health risks and benefits.","label":"true"}

The story makes it sound like we are a slam dunk away from seeing this test at the local radiology clinic. In reality, much larger studies with a much greater range of patients will be needed to tell whether the scan is effective enough to be widely used. Autism is difficult to diagnose due to its many different causes and symptoms\u00a0and because it often occurs with other similar neurodevelopmental disorders. A fast and accurate diagnostic brain scan would take much of the uncertainty out of the diagnostic process and would\u00a0hopefully speed\u00a0treatment and other support services to\u00a0patients.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11565,"claim":"Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain","explanation":"An independent expert can point out whether a study is valid and relevant and whether any cautionary notes should accompany its conclusions. The article provided an accurate, bare-bones description of the study and its main conclusions\u2014that yoga and intensive stretching were similarly effective and were both superior to the self-care intervention. But it also missed several key points, as detailed in the scoring below. And since the study in the Archives of Internal Medicine was actually accompanied by an independent commentary that could have been cited, these omissions are all the more telling. So what points might an independent expert have added to the coverage?The most important one is that the subjects in this study were relatively affluent and generally had mild back pain and modest functional limitations. The results of this study may not apply to the large body of patients from less affluent backgrounds with more severe back pain, greater functional impairment, and more complex health problems. Would a roughneck on an oil rig, an auto mechanic, or a hotel maid gain a similar benefit from yoga or intensive stretching as the subjects in this study? No one really knows. The availability of these treatments is also an issue. Similarly structured viniyoga programs may not be available in many communities\u2014and it is not clear that most health insurance plans will cover them. The type of intensive stretching program described in this study would appear to be uncommon in the United States. So most patients wouldn\u2019t have access to this intervention. Lastly, this study did not compare yoga and intensive stretching to \u201cusual care\u201d. So yoga and intensive stretching may be superior to a self-care program, but it is not as clear that they are any better than routine back care as dispensed across the United States. In the United States, back pain is the ninth most expensive medical condition for women, and the 10th for men, in terms of direct medical costs\u2014with chronic back pain accounting for a disproportionate chunk of those expenses. And the costs of work absence and disability claims related to back pain vastly exceed the medical price tag. Though Americans spend almost $35 billion per year on the medical treatment of back pain, the prevalence of chronic back pain appears to be rising\u2014and self-rated spinal health among Americans appears be declining. (See Soni, 2011; Freburger et al., 2008; and Martin et al., 2008). A number of nonsurgical treatments\u2014analgesics, exercise, manual therapies, complementary\/alternative therapies, psychological interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation\u2014are modestly effective in the management of chronic back pain. Yet for various reasons, Americans overuse ineffective treatments and underuse effective ones. (See Carey et al., 2009). So the identification of treatments that facilitate recovery and are popular with patients is a key social and medical priority.

{"claim_id":9142,"claim":"Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder","explanation":"This release from the NYU Langone Medical Center describes a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of children and adolescents with Dravet syndome, an extreme form of epilepsy, who often don\u2019t respond to other drugs. The release provides a very good description of the benefits and the side effects that were reported from the trial. It adds cautions and nuance that are missing from many news releases. But not included were the cost of the new drug (projected to be quite steep) and we think the release could have emphasized more that the children in the trial were already on seizure medications. When the cannabidiol (or a placebo) was added to the maintenance drug it alleviated seizures but also introduced a high degree of side effects. A CNN story on the study, which we also reviewed, had many of the same strengths as the news release (overall depth and detail on benefits), but it similarly skipped cost information. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy that generally begins in a child\u2019s first year but is a life-long condition, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Currently, treatments for this condition are marginal and new therapies addressing its symptoms would be welcome. The trial showed reduced seizures in this difficult-to-treat type of epilepsy compared to patients given a placebo. The lead researcher stressed that the study only tested cannabidiol in patients \u201cwith especially severe forms who have not responded to numerous medications\u201d\u00a0 and that the drug is not a panacea for other forms of epilepsy.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9853,"claim":"Test may help predict colon cancer recurrence risk","explanation":"Whether to give chemotherapy after surgery for localized colon cancer is controversial. Chemotherapy has significant side effects and the survival benefit is small. As is currently done for breast cancer, to be able to predict whether the tumor is likely to return after surgery would help guide treatment decisions about chemotherapy. This story reports on new results on a gene test for colon cancer tumors to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. Unfortunately the new test was only modestly able to predict colon cancer recurrence and failed to predict response to chemotherapy. Future research is clearly needed. This story adequately represents the novelty and availability of the test. It does not engage in disease mongering and is clear on the target of the test \u2013 colon cancers that are large but have not spread beyond the colon. It quotes multiples sources and is clear to point out who is invested in the development of the test. The story could have been improved by describing what is currently done to determine need for chemotherapy (i.e. pathology and\/or imaging tests), by providing the baseline average risk of recurrence as a comparison to the predicted risk from the\u00a0 test, and by describing potential harms of the test. Finally, the story doesn\u2019t really give any details on the current study or the overall strength of the evidence to support the use of the test. Although the story points out that the results will be presented at a meeting, it should have made the point that these studies are not rigorously peer-reviewed and evaluated prior to presentation, which makes it more difficult to evaluate the study at this time.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9093,"claim":"Small increases in physical activity reduce immobility, disability risks in older adults","explanation":"This university news release describes results of a study of sedentary elderly Americans enrolled in a federally funded study designed to document and improve their physical mobility and function. The release does a good job of describing the study methods and the conclusion that a modest increase of at least 48 minutes a week of moderately intense walking and walking-based strengthening exercises achieved significant, if not dramatic, decreases in average overall risk of major mobility disability over a two-year-plus period of time. It also paid appropriate attention to the \u201cdose-dependent\u201d benefits of the exercise regimen as compared to the control group\u2019s health education classes. That is, the greater the increase in minutes of exercise, the greater the benefits on average overall. It also noted the researchers\u2019 conclusion that although 150 minutes of exercise a week was the goal, seeing benefits at just 48 minutes does have implications for exercise compliance rates and the likelihood that even elderly couch potatoes might devote 15 minutes or so a few days a week to stay healthier. The release didn\u2019t include any numbers summarizing and putting the results in context. It also would have been strengthened by including a more detailed description of what \u201csedentary\u201d referred to. One notable inclusion was a paragraph devoted to weaknesses in the study. Bravo for that. As the U.S. population ages, increasing numbers of elderly signal their desire to live independently, and evidence for the benefits of consistent and persistent exercise grows, researchers, geriatricians and the public are clearly interested in identifying optimal and safe exercise regimens that people can do on their own, that don\u2019t require gym memberships or expensive equipment, and that \u2014 most of all\u2013 that people will stick to over the long haul. For many over 70 or 75 years of age, even half an hour a day can seem overwhelming. Thus, research suggesting that 20 minutes a day of moderately intense walking (with or without ankle weights), stretching, and balance exercises is a reasonable goal. Studies designed to demonstrate with some confidence that even moderate exercise can contribute to reduced risk of disability are likely to attract interest among caregivers and the public.","label":"MISLEADING"}

This story does not make clear to readers what information comes from the research that is the main subject and what comes from unrelated research or anecdotes. It doesn\u2019t put the research into the effects of Chantix on people who drink into context with existing drug treatments given to some people with alcohol problems. The story does provide cost and side effect information. Overall, this is making news out of a small study of the short-term (only hours) effects of a drug on the way alcohol affects human physiology. One could question the newsworthiness of this story about such a small, short-term study. News stories should make clear what\u2019s news and what\u2019s background. This story confuses things by trying to transform research into how people feel when they mix Chantix and alcohol into an advance in knowledge about how to reduce alcohol consumption, which this research did not test. Many alcoholics smoke. A magic bullet that helps both addictions would indeed be big news.

{"claim_id":11065,"claim":"In testing for allergies, a single shot may suffice","explanation":"This story reports on the use of a blood test, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), to diagnose allergies. The shots would replace the traditional method of diagnosis \u2013 a series of skin\u00a0pricks to show a reaction to various allergens. While this story does a good job of explaining the benefits of having one blood test compared to a series of skin pricks, the story does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence. The story states that the blood tests were developed in the 1970s but that newer tests have become available more recently. The story does say that the test is available and comments that its use is limited in the U.S. However, the story does not quantify the benefits of the blood test compared to the skin test. It is not clear from the story if the blood test results in better outcomes for the patient other than convenience and fewer side effects. The question of whether using the blood test in combination with treatment results in better outcomes for the patient is unanswered. Furthermore, the story only mentions one harm of the blood test \u2013 getting the blood drawn itself. The story should have mentioned other harms such as what happens with false positive or negative results or how the results may be misinterpreted by non-allergy specialist clinicians. Finally, the story commits disease mongering by not explaining that the blood and skin tests are only used in those with severe allergies. Most people with common pet or seasonal allergies will not require this kind of testing.

It offers readable explanations of how these researchers are modifying gene delivery\u00a0strategies to overcome tragic problems uncovered by earlier clinical studies that led to a wholesale halt in work with humans. But the bottom line here is that nearly all of the promising research of the present has been conducted in mice, making the enthusiasm that permeates this story premature.

O\u2019Bannon\u2019s statement implicitly accuses Planned Parenthood of breaking the law, so there\u2019s a burden on him to prove the organization profited from sales.

{"claim_id":9164,"claim":"Dry needling offers alternative to cortisone injection for hip pain","explanation":"This news release from an orthopedics journal relates a study finding that dry needling, which uses filament needles to stimulate trigger points in the muscles, is just as effective as cortisone injections when it comes to reducing pain and swelling caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), a common hip condition. We applaud its restrained tone but would have liked to get a sense of how much symptom improvement patients experienced during the six-week trial as well as a discussion of costs and availability of these two treatment options. This release says the effectiveness of steroid injections \u201cis increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial.\u201d To conclude that dry needling is \u201cnot inferior\u201d to a treatment that isn\u2019t very effective doesn\u2019t say much. There is no slam-dunk treatment for chronic hip pain. But if it comes with low risk and a modest cost, dry needling might be an alternative to steroids for combating chronic pain. Also, dry needling might offer an option for patients who haven\u2019t felt relief from steroids or are precluded from taking them due to medication interactions. As the release states, GTPS is very common and at times very painful. A safe,\u00a0successful treatment\u00a0that rapidly resolves pain (beyond normal natural healing) would benefit many individuals. A specific\u00a0risk profile of a single cortisone injection in the soft tissues has not been determined but most researchers and practicing physicians would consider it to be minimal.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":12525,"claim":"The GOP health bill \"would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.","explanation":"Various bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition. Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from \"would\" to \"could.\" The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don\u2019t know for sure given the bill\u2019s current form. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full: \"As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered \u2018essential\u2019. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill \u2018would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.\u2019 While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA. We should not even be discussing how women can be charged more for their care, even if it requires 2, 3, or 4 extra steps. This bill represents a step backwards for Americans\u2019 health in a number of ways.\" Click here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

{"claim_id":9496,"claim":"Therapy animals are everywhere.

The story includes input from an array of expert sources and offers a broad (if vague) overview of the research literature regarding therapy animals. There are some shortcomings here \u2014 for example, not much was said about the costs of pet therapy. However, in sum, the story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress. Tackling the efficacy of therapy animals is a challenging subject, given that the story evaluates an absence of conclusive evidence. However, it\u2019s an important subject. For example, therapy dogs can be expensive, which means a family may spend a great deal of money on a therapy animal \u2014 with little idea of whether the animal will provide meaningful benefits for a patient. Limited resources are available to help patients dealing with mental health issues, and it is important to ensure that those resources are used to achieve the maximum possible benefit. Resources that are being spent on unproven interventions are, obviously, not being used on interventions that have proven clinical benefits.

{"claim_id":9184,"claim":"Receiving a clot-buster drug before reaching the hospital may reduce stroke disability","explanation":"Mobile stroke unit, University of Tennessee College of Medicine Photo: Business Wire Clot busting drugs are an established part of the tool kit in reducing damage related to strokes. Understanding exactly when to administer them is key to making sure they are used in the most effective way possible. This release describes a study of one mobile stroke unit\u2019s experience administering clot-busting drugs \u2014 or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). These study findings have not been peer reviewed for publication in a journal and appear to have major caveats around them. We won\u2019t know all the details until the full study is published, and so we were pleased to see some caution expressed in the news release. A few more additions, like cost information and a better explanation of the benefits, would have helped make this release even better. [Editor\u2019s note: A reference to clot-busting drugs \u201csaving lives\u201d was removed from the review. As noted in the comments section, the scope of benefits offered by tPA is controversial and the American Heart Association withdrew \u201clife-saving\u201d claims about tPA as discussed in these BMJ and Mother Jones stories.] The recent deployment of a handful of mobile stroke units across the country staffed with specialists and CT scanners makes this a timely release, particularly amidst the backdrop of unsustainable health care costs. The cost of outfitting all US cities\u00a0with these\u00a0types of units would be\u00a0very great, and most of the new mobile units have been funded by private donors. Mobile stroke units could be most useful in remote areas where there is a long transport time from the scene to a\u00a0hospital that could give thrombolytic therapy, but those areas are the least likely to have enough volume of patients to sustain the expertise\u00a0of the mobile stroke unit\u2019s staff.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The one area of reasonable concern is that some jurisdictions may lack full due process for declaring someone mentally incompetent, potentially putting some people at risk of seeing their guns confiscated. But this depends on how proactively the authorities enforce gun laws. Experts say widespread gun confiscation is implausible. The rule isn\u2019t a law, it isn\u2019t enacted and it isn\u2019t unconstitutional according to Supreme Court jurisprudence.

While the release hits most of the key points that any journalist might ask when writing about this study, it offers too little discussion of harms and no mention of the drug\u2019s cost. People with psoriatic arthritis often have painful, red, scaly patches on their skin and they may not be effectively treated with TNF inhibitors (drugs commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions). If only half of\u00a0psoriatic arthritis patients get better with TNF inhibitors\u00a0then another option would be most welcome for those that have found no relief. The drug under study, ixekuzumab, appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of joint tenderness and swelling, and if it can provide these benefits at a reasonable level of safety, this could be a great advance.

In a perfect world the segment would be coherent and would feel apropos of something, but even that is not essential. Television is an ideal medium for this kind of demonstration. The problem is that when they put the segment together, the producers disposed of fundamental journalistic practices as efficiently as the daVinci Si HD bags up old organs to throw them away. Even if we accept that this piece is nothing more than a few minutes of techno-tainment, it still has inexcusable, almost inconceivable lapses in journalistic hygiene.

{"claim_id":9458,"claim":"Researchers identify CTE biomarker that may lead to diagnosis while alive","explanation":"The story focuses on a recent journal article that reported finding higher levels of the protein CCL11 in individuals who were posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) than was found in healthy individuals or in those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after an individual has died, and this finding is presented as a first step toward developing a diagnostic tool for CTE that can be used while patients are still alive. This is a very preliminary basic science research study and probably not worth publicizing to a general audience. As the story explains, no one really knows how relevant this finding is yet, and if it will lead to anything clinicians can use. The story at least makes that very clear, and tapped an independent source to provide context. CTE has been a huge news topic lately because of its association with professional football players. For this reason, research related to CTE is likely to get a lot of attention from readers.

As of Sept. 3, 185,092 Americans had died due to COVID-19. A CDC report found that 6% of people who died from COVID-19 only had the virus. The majority had other conditions as well, but that doesn\u2019t mean COVID-19 wasn\u2019t to blame.

{"claim_id":15775,"claim":"Whales live as long at SeaWorld\" as they do in the wild.","explanation":"A SeaWorld ad said \"whales live as long at SeaWorld\" as they do in the wild. At its core, this claim is an oversimplification of a much more complex issue. Recent independent data suggests that survival rates for captive and wild orcas are about equal, but that by itself isn't all that significant, experts told us. The data is limited and comparisons between orcas in captivity and in the wild are tenuous. Experts also noted that logic suggests\u00a0captive whales should live longer because they don't face predators and receive medical care, which makes SeaWorld's claim further misleading. Lastly, experts said that a simple measurement of survival rates (or lifespan) serves as a smokescreen from the more fundamental question of the conditions for whales in captivity. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":10326,"claim":"Provenge vaccine prolongs life in prostate cancer patients","explanation":"This story provides many of the key details readers need to understand the results of the trial of Provenge \u2013 being evaluated as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer \u2013 but the overall tone of the story emphasizes the good news while soft-peddling the caveats. Even though the story points out that only a third of men receiving the experimental approach were alive three years after they entered the trial, it would be understandable if readers concluded that Provenge is a dramatic advance in prostate cancer treatment and offers substantial advantages, with no disadavantages, compared to the chemotherapy typically offered similar patients. This USA Today story was about half the length of the AP report we also reviewed. Important facts were omitted that undercut the usefulness of the story; for example, the failure to note that the lead researcher owns stock in the company developing the drug or that the FDA declined to approve this drug two years ago because of concerns about potential side effects and questions about its actual effectiveness. While some cancer experts quoted elsewhere termed the trial findings an \"incremental\" advance, all of the comments included in this story portrayed the results as a dramatic advance. The story did not explain that the results have not been peer-reviewed and that independent experts have yet to see the raw data.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9832,"claim":"New Blood Test May Rule Out Heart Attacks More Quickly","explanation":"It simply isn\u2019t good enough to report on a new test being \u201cmore predictive\u201d or \u201cmore sensitive\u201d without giving actual data. How much more predictive? How much more sensitive? Why should readers care? Diagnosing a heart attack in the emergency room is as much of an art form as it is a science. Only a minority of people suspected of having one are actually diagnosed using a combined approach of a medical history, an electrocardiogram, a physical examination and finally laboratory tests. As our understanding of various blood markers improves, our tests have become more specific and the ability to correctly diagnose patients in a shorter period of time has improved. The use of a more specific maker of heart muscle injury and heart attack is important. As independent physicians quoted in the story explain, a more sensitive test could save a lot of money, could help with many emergency decisions and treatment,\u00a0 and may result in improved outcomes. Because of significant gaps in important details, this story misrepresents what the authors of the study concluded.","label":"false"}

The story clearly takes the viewpoint that this is the case, and yet we aren\u2019t given enough evidence from the study itself\u2013or other studies alluded to\u2013to make this assessment for ourselves. Instead, we\u2019re given partial \u201ctruth-isms\u201d like this statement, which doesn\u2019t really paint the full picture: \u201cAccidents are the most common cause of death in individuals with ADHD.\u201d What\u2019s missing?

If it were clear that this was an opinion piece designed to advance an argument, we\u2019d be more forgiving of these shortcomings. But we found the piece in the general health section of the website (not with the opinion columns), and the headline reads like a straight news story. Readers may be confused \u2014 as we were \u2014 as to whether this is objective, balanced news or just a columnist\u2019s attempt to persuade. The diagnosis of ADHD\u00a0is common, the impact of the condition is significant and the medications used have potential for adverse effects.

{"claim_id":11288,"claim":"Study: Fatty acids can help ease PMS symptoms","explanation":"The story didn\u2019t even report which symptoms improved, or even a list of what was being measured. There are so many symptoms associated with PMS \u2014 ranging from physical to behavioral \u2014 that it\u2019s important to know which symptoms they are talking about. Studies of PMS are notorious for showing a strong placebo effect, but we can\u2019t tell whether taking the supplement adds much benefit. There was also no discussion of cost and no independent expert perspective. Consumers spend millions of dollars on supplements, and these supplements are not well regulated. Any story about benefits runs the risk of sending people to their wallets, and they should be particularly cautious. Pre-menstrual syndrome, which is the butt of many jokes, is a severe problem for a small minority of women and can cause cyclic symptoms: bloating, fatigue, mood swings and headache. While only a minority has severe symptoms, many women have some of these.

Unfortunately, the story implies that the compound\u2013and more specifically broccoli consumption\u2013may be beneficial for humans for the same reasons.

{"claim_id":11081,"claim":"Gastric Balloon in a Pill Helps Patients Lose Weight Without Surgery or Endoscopy","explanation":"This release describes a new type of gastric balloon being developed that is inserted via a pill rather than through endoscopy. The interim study on the device was presented at an obesity medical conference and has not been peer-reviewed. The approach appears to be novel; a capsule containing a collapsed balloon is swallowed, then filled with water via a small attached catheter that remains outside the patient\u2019s mouth. After four months, a valve on the balloon opens and the balloon deflates and is excreted by the body. The small patient group (34 volunteers) in the study lost an average of 22 pounds after four months. The device\u2019s main advantage is that it is non-invasive (except for a small catheter which some could find uncomfortable) but the release is based on data that has not been peer-reviewed\u00a0or published. The release played down the limited evidence base\u00a0and possible harms and neglected costs. Obesity appears to be a problem that isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says America, at least, appears stuck in unhealthy lifestyle paterns. One-in-three Americans is obese. Obesity is a leading contributor to dozens of other health conditions. As a result, millions of people turn to\u00a0 gastric bypass, and the less intrusive (and less effective) gastric balloon and other medical procedures to try to lose weight when other methods fail. It seems the more effective the procedure is in taking off the weight, the more complications arise. The Eprise gastric balloon pill described in the release claims to be as effective but less intrusive as current methods. If it proves effective, it could be a welcome addition to the weight-loss arsenal.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Colonoscopy is considered the reference standard against which other colorectal cancer screening tests are measured, however, it is not perfect. Indeed, new data published ahead of print in this week\u2019s Annals of Internal Medicine suggest that colonoscopy may miss more cancers and polyps than previously thought and reduce colorectal-cancer specific mortality by 60 to 70% instead of the frequently-cited 90% reduction. This story does a good job of describing the current study and placing it in context with other studies. It explains the relevance of these new findings to the consumer \u2013 colonoscopy still prevents cancer deaths, however it has its limitations and people need to adjust their expectations of what it can do for them. Furthermore, the study rightly brings focus to the importance of proper preparation. The story could have been improved with a few simple additions.

Ultimately, though, like the Times piece, it did not take the extra step of giving readers and health policymakers the information they need to assess whether this industry-funded study is an important discovery.

{"claim_id":9819,"claim":"Nicotine Replacement Treatments May Not Work Long-Term","explanation":"This story managed to address nearly all of our criteria in this clearly written piece. We always wish stories had a little more detail about costs, and this one, like the other two reviewed, also missed information about harms. The main drawback to this story, though, was that it relied too heavily on people connected to GlaxoSmithKline, which makes some of the most popular nicotine replacement products. As this story points out, the research on nicotine therapy has been evolving. Because of the strength of so many clinical trials, people assume that patches, gum and other nicotine products work, but this study indicates that under real world conditions, these medicines might actually not show much benefit. The story says, \u201cIn the past five years, the declines in adult smoking seen in previous years have stalled\u201d. Jump starting those efforts is crucial giving the impact smoking has on population health. A Cochrane Report\u00a0 in 2008 reported on trials involving more than 40,000 subjects and concluded that nicotine replacement therapy improves the likelihood of smoking cessation in the short term. Although many people stop smoking, the return to smoking within a year is common. This study looks at the long term benefits over a 5 year period in the real world.

{"claim_id":11395,"claim":"Shire Announces Positive Results of SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents with ADHD","explanation":"This news release announces the results of a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of a long-acting stimulant drug for the treatment of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. The pharmaceutical company Shire completed this follow-up trial on the drug\u2019s safety and efficacy after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required more data when Shire first sought approval for the drug. The drug was tested in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with ADHD. The company claims that the drug showed significant improvement in both children and adolescents when compared with a placebo and on the clinical global impression improvement scale, a standardized measurement of improvement. While the release is clearly targeted to investors and financial reporters, it was distributed and made available to a wide public audience. Just because a release is written for a business audience does not mean it should skimp on transparency. Its biggest weakness is the strong claims it makes without providing any links or references to published research where the results can be evaluated. We perused the company\u2019s website for details of the study but came up empty-handed. The news release doesn\u2019t mention the lead investigator\u2019s financial relationship with the drug sponsor, projected costs of the new drug, nor make any comparisons with numerous similar drugs already on the market. This news release matters to the company since it is aiming to launch a new formulation (currently referred to as SHP465) of a drug similar to Adderall, also developed by Shire, which faces generic competitors. The new formulation essentially comes with a new patent for an old drug \u2014 the main difference being a longer half-life (or longer daytime effect) \u2014 16 hours versus 12 hours for the current Adderall extended release pill.

{"claim_id":9138,"claim":"Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner","explanation":"This news release attempts to translate preliminary research on plant chemicals into actionable dietary advice. Bad move. Researchers used an innovative screening strategy to cull through 142 natural compounds to identify a combination of three phytochemicals \u2014 found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and red grapes \u2014 that inhibited the growth of implanted prostate tumors in mice. Their work is described in the online journal Precision Oncology. But it\u2019s a big leap from the lab table to the dinner table, where the release says that by indulging in certain foods, you can \u201cenjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving \u2014 or even preventing \u2014 cancer.\u201d Nowhere does it warn that studies of cell lines or animals don\u2019t prove a human benefit. Combinations of plant chemicals have become a focus of cancer research, driven by their relative safety, low cost, and wide availability. Lab studies have found substances in plants can reduce inflammation, stimulate the immune system, protect and repair normal cells, and slow the growth of cancer cells, among other things. But research on the effects of these substances to fight specific cancers is still in its infancy, and most experts advise eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for better health. Prostate cancer is an area where men feel particularly vulnerable because it\u2019s widespread \u2014 about 3 million American men are living with prostate cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute \u2014 and there are few actionable steps for prevention. Suggesting a simple solution \u2014 such as eating a few specific foods \u2014 may give men a false sense of security.","label":"false"}

Those numbers aren\u2019t totally accurate, and the comparison itself is misleading. For one, it counts\u00a0many officers' deaths that had nothing to do with the prohibition of drugs or alcohol,\u00a0like an officer who dies of cancer or in a car crash on vacation. And despite the direct comparison between the deadly years of Prohibition and the war on drugs, police deaths\u00a0have largely been on the decline for decades even as the drug war continues and the number of officers has grown significantly.

However, while the story accurately summarizes some of the important study results, it fails to alert readers to vital details about the trial design and funding. Not only is there no mention that the makers of the drug paid for the trials and hired writers to produce the article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, the lone independent expert quoted actually receives consulting and speaking fees from one of the drug makers. Also, the story mentions three patients, but not one who had less than spectacular results. Including one of the many patients who did not see their eczema and itching completely disappear would have provided a more balanced view of the trial results. When a drug study is paid for and written by companies that are seeking FDA approval for a treatment, stories should pay special attention to conflicts of interest, study design, and the way the results are presented, in order to help readers sort out hard facts from sponsor spin.

{"claim_id":9698,"claim":"12 Minutes of Yoga for Better Bone Health","explanation":"This is a thorough and balanced report of research into the effects of yoga on bone density. While yoga provides a range of potential health benefits including increased flexibility, balance and strength (all factors which can help prevent falls and fractures), the researchers focused specifically on whether a 12 minute per day yoga routine could increase bone density. Although improvements were found after\u00a0a decade of research, helpful\u00a0caveats about the limitations of the study (lack of a control group, self-reported nature of the study)\u00a0kept it away from the realm of exaggeration. Yoga is hugely popular and growing in importance, so understanding the specific effects of daily practice of yoga could influence\u00a0current thinking about its role in disease prevention and health promotion. If a specific effect of yoga on bone density is likely then possibly reducing fracture risk through daily yoga practice could be a viable alternative to ingesting bisphosphonate drugs.

{"claim_id":11057,"claim":"Oregano, Thyme May Hold the Cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease","explanation":"This release suffers from over-reach and obfuscation \u2014 a bad combination. The release cites some pre-clinical animal\u00a0research at the University of Iowa that suggests that components of the spices oregano and thyme may represent a \u201ccure\u201d for cachexia, a wasting disease that affects cancer patients and others with debilitating diseases. Unfortunately, readers aren\u2019t told that the research was in mice \u2014 not humans \u2014 until very late in the release. There\u2019s no information on whether the research has been published, or met any other form of peer review. (When we asked to see the study, the media relations team at the university declined and told us the research hadn\u2019t been published.) The spice compounds referred to aren\u2019t named, nor are cost or potential harms addressed. The release doesn\u2019t explain who funded the research or disclose that the university has applied for a patent on the compound. It doesn\u2019t note that the researcher quoted in the release is listed as the inventor on the patent application and would likely stand to benefit financially from its commercialization. The release does note that\u00a0a pharmaceutical firm has been licensed to market a drug based on the research. Editor\u2019s note: This news release raised serious questions about oversight of the University of Iowa\u2019s research-related communications to the public. We blogged about those questions here but have yet to receive a satisfactory response from the university media relations team. Update 8\/24\/17: A response received from the university, more than two weeks after the initial request, raises additional serious questions about the university\u2019s process for promoting research, which critics termed \u201cutterly irresponsible.\u201d We wrote about it here. Cachexia is a serious condition typified by chronic weight loss that can affect a patient\u2019s nutritional status and ability to undergo or continue treatment. Striking those with chronic diseases, it weakens patients and in some cases can hasten their demise. If it could be thwarted by compounds from spices, that would represent a real boon. But this release \u2014 and the research it reports \u2014 does not provide readers with valid and adequate information. Unfortunately, it may play on the hopes of those afflicted with cachexia and their families, offering false hopes instead of new findings.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10659,"claim":"Hard questions about chemo","explanation":"This is an important piece about a major problem in healthcare costs in the U.S. Even for people with life-threatening illness (that is not acute, and treated as an inpatient), care is not guaranteed for those who cannot pay. There is enough variation in costs of potential treatment regimens that the practice of informing patients about cost with treatment options should be encouraged. Although distressing, launching a family into financial disaster is an adverse outcome as well. This particular story focuses on the increasing cost of 2nd or 3rd-line chemotherapy drugs aimed at advanced cancer. The story notes that patients are often forced to choose between these treatments and their financial savings. The story explains that because the market for\u00a0 certain drugs is small and focused, the cost of these chemotherapy drugs is higher. The story appropriately notes that cost should be discussed as an additional side effect of treatment. The story notes via an American Cancer Society rep that it \"costs a billion dollars\" to bring a drugs to market; however, we are not told of the typical profit made from these drugs once they are available to patients. This is an oversight in reporting about cost. There is also considerable debate about the validity of that claim about pharma\u2019s R&D costs \u2013 which the story does not address. The story does not discuss how these newer drugs work, or how much quantity and quality of life they add to patients\u2019 lives. The story does not discuss if newer drugs are any better than older drugs for treating cancer. We are told that some newer drugs have fewer or different side effects. The story provides information on alternative older drugs that may be an option for cancer treatment.

This story reports the results of a study that compared the genetic profile of tumors to the long-term cancer recurrence rate in a group of women. The story provides multiple views and useful context. However, most readers would likely assume that treatment decisions that incorporate these test results would offer better health outcomes. This story should have clearly stated that this study was not designed to answer that important question and that follow-up trials will be need to document the health effects of using this test. Predicting risk is one thing. Knowing which treatment is most likely to produce the best outcome for a patient with a certain risk level is a different question. People often confuse the two; so news reports about risk assessment should take special care to point out that improving the ability to predict a patient\u2019s future does not necessarily mean that you can change that future.

There\u2019s no way to track how many people on the list legally bought weapons at gun shows, as those transactions aren\u2019t subject to federal background checks.

But given the large size of the terror watch list \u2014 with perhaps 10,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners \u2014 it\u2019s reasonable to assume that 200 or more on the list made legal weapons purchases each year over the past decade.","label":"true"}

It\u2019s one of two stories we reviewed about this important and newsworthy study. The other is from Fox News. This report is appropriately cautious, emphasizing that the treatment is not a cure but reduces the threat from accidental exposure. In addition, the story details the commitment that treatment requires and the side effects that can occur. However, it could have done a better job by addressing the cost of this drug and giving the dropout rate of those on the treatment. Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies. It typically presents early in life, is known for severe reactions, and is rarely outgrown. There currently are no treatments for peanut allergy, besides emergency care in the event of a reaction. So a treatment with the potential to make reactions from accidental exposures less severe is certainly of interest.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9351,"claim":"Worried About Dementia? You Might Want to Check Your Blood Pressure","explanation":"This NPR report built around exhortations to control blood pressure by the head of a federal health agency draws attention to the long-documented links between hypertension and some forms of dementia. For many, many reasons, diagnosing and treating high blood pressure are good ideas for maintaining health and preventing strokes and heart disease, and the better news is that there are dozens of drugs and lifestyle changes available \u2014 some of them very inexpensive \u2014 to help people do so. But this story doesn\u2019t explain that the evidence for an association between high blood pressure and vascular dementia, much less Alzheimer\u2019s disease, is so far mostly observational. And perhaps more significantly, the story carries no data at all to support even the claims or strengths\/weaknesses of the association. This\u00a0NPR story missed an opportunity to offer the data and help the public understand more about risk assessment and probabilities of disease related to blood pressure. And it may mislead people into thinking that if they pop a pressure pill each day, they will avoid Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. That\u2019s unproven.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9475,"claim":"A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy","explanation":"The story focuses on a long-term follow-up study of patients with peanut allergies who had received immunotherapy and probiotics to minimize allergic response to peanuts. A story in a nationwide publication that suggests there may be a \u201ccure\u201d for peanut allergies \u2014 such as the story we are reviewing here \u2014 would likely raise hopes for families and individuals living with peanut allergies. But those hopes would be unfounded. The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment \u2014 something the story doesn\u2019t tell readers. And the treatment was not universally successful at eliminating peanut allergy even for those 24 patients. What\u2019s more, there is no discussion in the story of costs or risks associated with treatment. The word \u201ccure\u201d should never be used hastily, something we just pointed out about a different TIME story last week. The NIH states that \u201cpeanut allergy is a growing health problem for which no treatment or cure exists. People living with peanut allergy, and their caregivers, must be vigilant about the foods they eat and the environments they enter to avoid allergic reactions, which can be severe and even life-threatening.\u201d A 2010 study stated that 1.4 percent of people in the U.S. report having an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts. In short, peanut allergy poses very real risks for those with peanut allergies, and can pose a particular challenge for parents of children with peanut allergies \u2014 who have to maintain constant vigilance regarding the possibility of peanut contamination in places where their kids eat, play or attend school. As a result, new research findings related to addressing peanut allergies garner a lot of attention. This story may leave readers with more questions than answers.","label":"false"}

There was no discussion of cost impact of the findings, or about whether insurance might curtail coverage of lymph node dissection. There was no discussion of the researchers\u2019 admission of what could be potentially important limitations in the research. The story didn\u2019t explain how often complications of lymph node dissection occur. Women who have an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following a diagnosis of breast cancer, sometimes develop infections at the surgery site or lymphedema. Depending on its severity, lymphedema can be painful, disfiguring, and expensive to treat. While the symptoms of lymphedema can be treated, especially if caught early, once a person develops lymphedema, the person is always at risk for a recurrence of the lymphedema. If ALND confers no mortality or disease-free survival benefit,\u00a0it\u00a0may no longer be recommended as standard treatment for women with T1 or T2\u00a0breast cancer with positive nodes as determined by sentinel lymph node dissection.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9909,"claim":"Hip resurfacing aimed at boomers","explanation":"The AP news story does a nice job of explaining what hip resurfacing is and how it fits into the history of hip replacement procedures. It summarizes the current availability of hip resurfacing in the US. However, the story provides virtually no evidence on the efficacy of resurfacing to support the mostly glowing testimonials of the three surgeons it quotes. According to the news article, the FDA \u201ccited studies showing the Birmingham Hip resurfacer lasted at least five years\u2026\u201d What sorts of studies did the FDA analyze? What about the rest of the outcomes that patients value\u2014such as improvements in pain and activity? Are there any randomized trials that compare similar patients who have undergone resurfacing with patients who have undergone total hip replacement? Is there follow-up beyond five years? These questions remain unanswered. The discussion of harms is likewise incomplete. The news article points out that hip resurfacing isn\u2019t for everyone, and mentions two groups in whom it might not be appropriate. But the available research suggests the picture may be more complicated. There is disagreement about whether the procedure impairs the blood supply to bone or generates so much heat that it could cause the death of thigh bone. Bone death (necrosis of the femoral head) is a devastating complication for which there is currently no good solution. Other studies suggest additional potential problems. (For references and more details on potential harms, see \u201cHarms of Treatment\u201d above.) Although it is true that some researchers have found few problems with the devices and reported great success, readers deserve to know where the uncertainties lie. Perhaps the greatest uncertainty has to do with how long the implants will hold up. Though sufficient for FDA approval, survival of \u201cat least five years\u201d is not a strong endorsement. Total joint replacement, by comparison, has a track record extending 15 to 25 years. A closer look at the evidence might have reshaped the take-home message from this news report.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10711,"claim":"Millions face risk from drug-coated stents","explanation":"Drug-eluting or drug-coated stents were first introduced in the\u00a0U.S. in the\u00a0mid-90s. Ten years later, they have all but replaced traditional stents because of their ability to prevent the clogged artery from closing again. However, new information suggests that these stents may in fact be causing some clots to form. This story reports on this development and does a decent job of explaining the problem, but falls short in explaining the strength of the available evidence and overstating the potential benefits from stenting. Although the story does describe the clot risk as 2 or 3 percent, the story should have provided more information here, such as, what is the time frame? How often are they fatal? How does this number compare to alternative options? Furthermore, the story inappropriately suggests that the benefits of stenting include a reduction in heart attacks. By accurately describing the prevalence of stenting, the story avoids disease mongering. However,\u00a0the story verges on treatment mongering by describing stents as a \"life-saving device\" and suggesting that they can preventing heart attacks. The story does not describe the strength of the available evidence on the harms from stenting. Furthermore, the story does not mention medications as an alternative treatment option, nor does the story describe the costs of stenting for an indiviual or relative to the alternatives.

{"claim_id":9034,"claim":"FDA authorizes marketing of first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussion in adults","explanation":"The Food and Drug Administration approved for marketing a blood test that uses the presence of certain proteins to predict whether adults with a suspected concussion have structural brain injury, and which could conceivably reduce the number of people who undergo costlier computed tomography (CT) scans. The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Its anticipated that knowing these levels can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which don\u2019t. We wish the release had included the research institutions involved and any publications relating to the study\u00a0so that we could evaluate the evidence. This evidence was also missing from a CNN story we also reviewed on the test. There were approximately 2.8 million traumatic brain injury (TBI) visits to the emergency department in 2013, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and of these, TBI contributed to the deaths of 50,000 people.The release predicts that about one-third of patients may be able to forego CT scans because of this test\u2019s predictive value. While the blood test reportedly has high sensitivity and specificity, logistical issues may lead doctors to do the test and continue to scan. Emergency department doctors may not be able to wait at least 3-4 hours for the blood test results since this would impact other workflows. News releases about concussion are bound to get a lot of attention. In this case, the news release doesn\u2019t clearly spell out to lay readers what this test does. It\u2019s not a test for concussion, as a casual reader might glean from the way it\u2019s worded.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9470,"claim":"Ecstasy could be \u2018breakthrough\u2019 therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD","explanation":"Post-traumatic stress disorder is difficult to treat. Over the course of the past decade, evidence has been accumulating that the compound 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), better known as ecstasy, may be more effective than current drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil. This story, jump-started by a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration to classify MDMA as a \u201cbreakthrough drug,\u201d which allows it to be evaluated and possibly approved more quickly, offers the reader a well-written account of the evolution of MDMA from a bad actor to a potentially efficacious one. An important element of the narrative is the dominant role of a nonprofit organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is dedicated to ending government bans on psychedelic substances and marijuana and has funded virtually all of the extant research on MDMA\u2019s impact on PTSD sufferers. While the story is well-sourced, the text fails to explore this conflict of interest. It also may land too heavily on the side of \u201cprobable\u201d rather than \u201cpossible.\u201d The headline\u2014Ecstasy could be \u201cbreakthrough\u201d therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD\u2014is worded conditionally but clearly heralds the dawn of a new age. Given the long clinical trial road ahead, despite MDMA\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough\u201d status designation, much could change. The substance MDMA may meet all evidentiary challenges and emerge at some point in the future as an effective part of the treatment regimen for PTSD. But drumming up enthusiasm for the drug before it is officially available, as this story may do, runs the risk of sending PTSD sufferers to a less safe\u2014and certainly illegal\u2014form: Ecstasy.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":10289,"claim":"Chelation based on faulty premise","explanation":"This story discusses chelation,\u00a0\u00a0the use of drugs to \u2018bind\u2019 heavy metals in the body so that they can be excreted, for the potential treatment of autism spectrum disorder in children. Chelation is based on the largely discredited view that mercury in vaccines triggers autism. Under this theory, removing heavy metals like mercury from the body will \u2018cure\u2019 autism. This story does a good job of presenting evidence about this harmful and potentially fatal practice. It successfully addresses the disease-mongering that could result around this emotionally charged issue. The story was well done but could have included a few more details such as the cost of various chelation treatment. Autism spectrum disorder is a devastating condition that affects thousands of children and their families each year and the number of cases continues to rise.

{"claim_id":9311,"claim":"Researcher: Alzheimer's vaccine could cut dementia in half, human trials may be next","explanation":"This story reports on a study done in laboratory mice that showed a vaccine decreased the build-up of two proteins, amyloid and tau, that are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. The story mentions this was a mouse study and acknowledges it isn\u2019t the only potential avenue under study to arrest those harmful substances. However, it gives an overly optimistic spin, using the word \u201cpromising\u201d and playing up a speculative comment in a UT Southwestern Medical Center news release that dementia cases \u201ccould drop by half\u201d if there\u2019s a vaccine that delays the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s by five years. The story also doesn\u2019t caution that success in animals often doesn\u2019t translate to benefits in humans, and that other treatments targeting these proteins have not panned out. Also missing: discussions of costs and potential harms and comments from independent sources. As the U.S. population ages, dementia is becoming more common. Millions of families are coping with a person who has a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s. Available treatments do not prevent or cure Alzheimer\u2019s and at best slow down the progression of symptoms for short periods. Considerable effort has focused on new treatments that seek to break down or prevent the deposition of abnormal proteins that appear to increase as memory loss progresses. So far these new treatments have not been shown to help. Initially they were tried in individuals with advanced disease but now are being used in patients with mild symptoms as a way to prevent progression. Even here, trials have not shown positive results that are clinically meaningful. A vaccine to \u201cprevent\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s is appealing in that it works even earlier in the process, maybe even before symptoms appear. However, it isn\u2019t clear that a vaccine will actually improve clinical outcomes. The fact that this small study in mice led to several optimistic headlines \u2014 not just USA Today\u2019s \u2014 reflects how desperate we are for progress. Regardless, news stories should not make a remedy sound closer and more certain than it is.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":8954,"claim":"Midwifery linked to lower odds of birth complications for low-income women","explanation":"This news release touted an observational study that found low-income women in British Columbia who used midwives for prenatal care experienced fewer complications than those who used general practitioners or obstetricians. The study was published in the British Medical Journal Open. Commendably, the release used mostly cautious language, stating the study adds \u201cnew evidence in support of midwives as a safe option.\u201d However, it did not quantify adequately the differences in the outcomes or explain the limitations of observational data. Midwifery can fill an important need for wider access to care for pregnant women. Advocates for midwives say they reduce unnecessary care, cost less, and lead to great patient satisfaction. Still, news releases should stress the need for ongoing research to assess how the use of midwives affects pregnancy outcomes. The research report describes the study\u2019s context well, noting that at this stage in the evolution of midwifery care in Canada, a randomized trial could not be supported based on the limited evidence that midwifery care is at least as good as traditional care. Studies such as this one, while not providing a definitive answer, add to our knowledge of the safety of midwifery care and pave the way for further studies that establish its benefits and risks.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9959,"claim":"The test that reveals cancer sooner","explanation":"This news release describes findings from a retrospective study on a blood test marketed for the early detection of cancer, in this case asbestos-related malignant mesothelioma. The test screens for the presence of the protein ENOX2 which researchers say exists only on the surface of a malignant cancer cell. The MorNuCo company is \u201celated to share\u201d news about this \u201cexciting\u201d ONCOblot cancer marker blood test. To make sure you don\u2019t miss the \u201cexciting\u201d point, the word is used three times in a release that is only nine sentences long. The release falls short on data and relies on fear-mongering to engage people worried about cancer risk because of exposure to asbestos. The release flogs the myth that early detection is always a good thing, thus raising false hopes. To give powerful cancer treatments too soon, or even unnecessarily, does enormous harm, justified only if the potential benefit is clear. Not only does this study of the ONCOblot test fail to provide any evidence that early detection could provide a benefit to people exposed to asbestos (most of whom will never get mesothelioma), the retrospective study of a few people who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma cannot even demonstrate that the test could reliably predict who is likely to develop the disease, something that will have to be tested by prospective studies. The authors of the study noted the following in their conclusions: \u201cAs with all biomarker studies, these observations\u00a0require validation in a larger, independent cohort of\u00a0patients and should include prospective as well as retrospective\u00a0sampling.\u201d The news release failed to communicate that message.","label":"false"}

It should also have given readers some of the context available in documents posted online by the FDA, Pfizer and other sources about the state of the science regarding this drug. On the plus side, the story makes clear that this drug is meant for a small and very specific group of patients. It also is clear about the high cost of the therapy. People with often-deadly diseases such as advanced lung cancer are hungry for new treatments. Journalists have a responsibility to put preliminary suggestions of progress toward new treatments in the proper context.

Candesartan works by blocking the action of a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, candesartan relaxes blood vessels and this lowers blood pressure. There is evidence of disease mongering in this story: The classification of \u201cprehypertension\u201d (systolic 130-139 mm Hg and 85-89 mm Hg diastolic) is still debatable by some medical experts, and whether prehypertension alone is a strong predictor of future heart disease is also debatable. Blood pressure increases as a natural part of aging, so whether prehypertension or mild hypertension should be viewed as a condition or disease and treated with costly medication needs further study. Hypertension is only one of several risk factors that contributes to heart disease. A prehypertensive or mildly hypertensive person with low risk factors and a healthy lifestyle may not benefit from drug treatment as much as someone with greater risk of heart disease and an unhealthy behaviors, such as a poor diet, lack of exercise and smoking. The story does mention lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as a \u201ccornerstone of controlling blood pressure,\u201d however, comparison is only anecdotal and there is no mention of studies examining the effect of lifestyle modification on prehypertension or hypertension. The story mentions limiting salt and water as part of lifestyle modification. A reduced sodium diet may help control hypertension, but reducing water will not help most people decrease blood pressure. There is not much quantitative information on the risk reduction from taking an ARB to prevent hypertension. There was some modest protective benefit in the treatment group at 4 years (absolute reduction 9.8%), though the story says those who took the drug for 2 years and then a placebo for an additional 2 years \u201cmatched the placebo group\u201d. There is no discussion of the side effects of this anti-hypertensive drug, nor is there discussion of long-term safety of taking this medication for many years as a means of prevention. The most common side effects of ARBs are cough, elevated potassium levels, low blood pressure, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, abnormal taste sensation (metallic or salty taste), and rash. In this study, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness and headaches were more common in the treatment group, though in most cases, the difference was small. This class of drugs are typically more expensive than other anti-hypertensive medications, but there is no mention of the cost of taking this medication daily for prevention of hypertension. Also, there is no comparison of ARB treatment with less costly anti-hypertensive medications such a diuretics, or a cost comparison with lifestyle modification. Lastly, the story appropriately notes that the makers of the candesartan sponsored and help design the study. What is not mentioned is that the lead author also serves as a consultant to the drug company and has other grant support from AstraZeneca, the makers of the drug.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10755,"claim":"Chinese herb may yield drug for AIDS","explanation":"This story is about bevirimat, a new drug for late stage HIV. While there is interesting background on the current stage of HIV\/AIDS drug development in the story, it has several important flaws. The story provides no evidence on the safety or efficacy of this drug, despite the drug company president\u2019s comments that bevirimat \u201c. . .looks potent and has a great safety profile\u201d. What is the evidence? The story does not discuss the potential side effects of this new drug, and it does not provide a caveat that the drug may not live up to its predicted effect in humans. The story mentions that this new drug would be taken in combination with current antiretroviral therapies. But there is no discussion of any possible negative interaction(s) with other HIV drugs, or with drugs for co-existing medical conditions. Researchers and physicians who work with HIV\/AIDS therapies are cited to provide perspective on this potential new treatment in the context of current therapies. Sources who are also paid consultants for Panacos Pharmaceuticals are appropriately noted. Some appropriate attempt at balance is provided by the concluding quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. There is one error in the article: \u201cPeople who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.\u201d Presumably they meant that people starting treatment in 2003 are EXPECTED to live 13 yrs longer. The story provides appropriate prevalence and incidence data on Americans living with HIV. If anything, the story under-reports HIV prevalence worldwide. The story might have aked the question: If this therapy is approved, would it be made available to the millions infected with HIV in developing countries? Finally, the story does not provide any projections of what the drug might cost. But the story was able to estimate annual sales of the drug for Panacos Pharmaceuticals. If you can give the latter, you should be able to provide the former.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9270,"claim":"Injected Drug Reduces Risk of Fracture among Women with Osteoporosis","explanation":"There\u2019s so much to like about this news release. In particular, it does a wonderful and economical job summarizing the benefits of the drugs being studied. It provides the numbers in both absolute and relative terms, for example. But it skimps on some of the details, chiefly the costs of the drugs, that the funder of the study makes one of the drugs in question, and whether the drugs are experimental or on the market. Osteoporosis is a well-known risk factor for fracture, especially among older women. It can also be screened for with x-rays that measure bone density. A number of different treatments exist for individuals with osteoporosis and this news release presents data from a published study in JAMA. For most individuals with osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D supplements are recommended if dietary consumption isn\u2019t adequate. First-line medications to decrease fracture risk\u00a0is a group called the bisphosphonates. These medicines have been around for several decades and are usually taken by mouth on a weekly basis or by injection once a year. For individuals who are at particularly high risk, including those who have had a fracture while taking a bisphosphonate, second-line therapy is considered. These medicines include teriparatides that are given as a daily injection under the skin. The current study compares a new version of this class of drug,\u00a0abaloparatide, to placebo and\u00a0teriparatide. As a related editorial highlights, there are a number of effective medicines to prevent fractures in those with osteoporosis and they are probably under-used. For most individuals, use of existing oral medicines should be the focus of initial treatment. The current study focuses on giving patients who didn\u2019t respond to the initial therapy or other high risk individuals another option.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":8951,"claim":"'Universal' blood test for earlier diagnosis of cancer moves closer to market","explanation":"Blood tests have become a popular study focus among scientists seeking mechanisms for early detection of cancer. Researchers have come up with a number of tests in recent years that examine a variety of components of blood, among them types of blood cells, proteins, and the presence of mutated DNA. Most of the tests are specific to particular cancers and vary in their levels of accuracy. In this release, a team at the University of Bradford heralds the increasing accuracy of a test that measures the response of white blood cells exposed to ultraviolet light. The test, called TumorScan, uses an automated cell reader designed by a Paris-based company, IMSTAR, to examine thousands of cells from any one sample, and the researchers say that they have found the process can detect the presence of any type of cancer with more than 90% success. IMSTAR has now licensed the university team\u2019s technology and plans to bring the text to market some time in the future. The release touts the potential benefits without addressing some real concerns:\u00a0Technology like this is enabling us to find more and more cancers at an earlier stage, but we are often unable to differentiate between the ones that need to be treated and those that can be monitored or ignored. While the news release didn\u2019t need to go into great detail about this, it should at least acknowledge the downsides. Finding cancer at an early stage via a blood test may improve survival rates, and reduce the need for invasive biopsies. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that all cancer screening tests carry the risks of false-positives, false-negatives and overdiagnosis and treatment of non-growing or slow-growing cancer.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10910,"claim":"New drug \u2018may turn back the clock on heart disease\u2019","explanation":"This was an overly enthusiastic account of a study on an experimental new drug called\u00a0anacetrapib\u00a0that lowers bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol. The study was designed to look primarily at the safety of the drug and not whether it prevented heart attacks. But that didn\u2019t prevent the story from making some wildly positive statements about the likely benefits of treatment. The story\u00a0stumbles out of the gate with an over-the-top prediction about how the drug \u201cmay conquer heart disease.\u201d \u00a0It continues to lay on the hype with quotes about the \u201cincredible\u201d results and how the drug could be \u201cthe perfect new treatment for all people at risk of a heart attack.\u201d We realize some of this enthusiasm came from the mouths of experts but we know there are many who would be far more cautious and we didn\u2019t hear from them in the story. It closes with an erroneous description of how many people died in the study. Needless to say, not what we hope to see on the front page of the nation\u2019s highest-circulating daily. By comparison, look at how NPR closed their online story: \u201cStill there were four deaths from cardiovascular causes among the 800 patients taking Merck\u2019s drug compared with just one among the same number in the the just-released trial results. So don\u2019t count Merck\u2019s drug approved just yet.\u201d (Please note:\u00a0we reviewed the first version of each story that we found \u2013 not any subsequent versions the news orgs may have published. In fact, the version we reviewed doesn\u2019t even appear online anymore.) It would nice if preventing heart attacks was\u00a0just a matter of lowering bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. However, research increasingly suggests that it isn\u2019t as simple as that. Drugs that lower bad cholesterol through one mechanism do appear to be effective, but drugs that lower it another\u00a0way may not offer the same protection. Similarly,\u00a0people with naturally high good cholesterol\u00a0seem to have a low risk of heart attacks, but not every drug that raises good cholesterol has cardiovacular benefits. (In fact, another experimental drug that raises good cholesterol\u00a0was shown recently to increase the risk of heart attacks.) So far, the drug discussed in this story doesn\u2019t appear to have the same problems as its good cholesterol-raising predecessor, but at this early stage of development we\u00a0simply don\u2019t know if it works. Larger\u00a0studies might show that the drug has safety problems that haven\u2019t shown up in this study. Or it might turn out that the drug is\u00a0safe but\u00a0doesn\u2019t offer much protection. Some drugs even get approved only to later be recalled because of rare but\u00a0serious adverse effects that aren\u2019t apparent until millions of people start taking the medicine. This is all a way of saying that\u00a0caution is required when a drug is this early in its development. There are any number of ways that it could get derailed prior to reaching the market, and so journalists have to take care not get too caught up in the excitement.","label":"false"}

If this device described in the release, called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS), could help emergency personnel determine where to take patients with suspected stroke for treatment (a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center) then it might be very valuable. The release describes a published study on the VIPS diagnostic tool showing that it can accurately detect large-vessel occlusion (a blockage or closing of a blood vessel) in patients with suspected stroke yet it misses some of the key features you\u2019d expect with a news release talking about a new diagnostic tool, especially its cost, and its accuracy measured against other methods, such as a mobile CT scan, to differentiate strokes. If care could be improved by a speedier, easy to use device which helps decide whether endovascular therapy (a procedure used to treat problems affecting the blood vessels) is necessary this could well improve outcomes for stroke patients. Researchers at the\u00a0Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Mount Sinai, the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center and elsewhere published a study in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery suggesting that their device (a visor worn by emergency personnel) called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) was better at identifying patients with large-vessel occlusions than a standard physical examination. This matters because if the device passes all the other tests we expect of diagnostic tools including showing it\u2019s sufficiently sensitive and specific and an improvement over other methods, then it could more quickly route patients to stroke centers that have endovascular capabilities and have a large impact on the outcome of patients.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9895,"claim":"For Cold Virus, Zinc May Edge Out Even Chicken Soup","explanation":"This story discusses the results of a systematic review from the Cochrane Collaboration suggesting that zinc reduces the duration and severity of the common cold. While the column does a nice job of pointing out some of the limitations of the studies included in the review and highlights the fact the review authors cannot make a recommendation for the dosage or preparation, it missed the mark on a few key points. For instance, there was no discussion of costs, (which seems like an important omission, as many readers will want to try the over-the-counter products), there was little mention of the adverse effects of zinc, and there was no commentary from an independent expert. Although most of us view the common cold as a mere nuisance, the infection can have serious clinical and economic impact. The common cold is responsible for a large number of lost work days, lost school days and physician visits. Over $400 million is spent annually in the US for over-the-counter remedies.

{"claim_id":9298,"claim":"Metformin may lower lung cancer risk in diabetic nonsmokers","explanation":"This release reports on an NIH-funded study to\u00a0determine if the use of the drug metformin by diabetic patients may affect their risk of developing lung cancer. The overall answer is that it does not,\u00a0but the release takes five paragraphs to say that. Instead, it\u00a0focuses on a very small subset of patients who had never smoked and whose lung cancer risk appeared to be lower than never-smokers who didn\u2019t take metformin. By trumpeting findings from that subgroup \u2014 and burying the main results of the study, which were negative \u2014 this release misrepresents the research findings and misleads its readers. We\u2019d suggest that the findings of this study probably did not warrant the spotlight provided by\u00a0a news release. But if a news release is to be issued, it should lead with the results for the primary outcome and give second billing to provocative but preliminary findings from subgroups. While not as egregious as another example of subgroup \u201cspin\u201d\u00a0that we recently reported on, this news release will certainly give readers the impression that there\u2019s something special about metformin when it comes to preventing cancer in people with diabetes, when that hasn\u2019t been established with any certainty. Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long-term use of drugs such as metformin. Some research suggests that metformin may decrease the risk of lung cancer \u2014 making the results of this study an important addition to the scientific literature. Unfortunately, the release focuses almost entirely on the results seen in a small subgroup of patients. As such, it doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the totality of the research in question. Subgroup findings can be included, but should never supersede the main outcome.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11485,"claim":"New Portable Scanner for Breast Cancer","explanation":"Nowhere do we hear how far along the research is. The main section doesn\u2019t even allude to evidence, other than to state that more research is to be done, which is true about most everything in medicine except limes for scurvy. As far as a reader can tell, the \u201cnew portable scanner\u201d may have yet to leave a laboratory setting. All we know is that it\u2019s been submitted to, and is a finalist for, an engineering & technology award. It\u2019s not the same as clinical research. The article is quick to point out mammography\u2019s low detection rates (sensitivity, perhaps?) in younger women, identifying the problem to be solved, but it never tells us the detection rates for the new tool. The data very well may be unknown. Which means detection rates could be worse! But from the structure of this article, focusing on technology but not evidence, a reader could only conclude the new kid on the block is superior. If we\u2019re lucky, the new kid will make the world a better place. But filing a patent for a device is not the same level of proof as clinical research. People would be shocked to learn how many promising ideas from labs and napkins never survive clinical trials, how many prove to be worse for mankind than what we already do. Science is hard and complex. Last year\u2019s uproar over the new mammography guidelines highlighted that there are important subtleties about screening for cancer, and that clear, balanced communication is crucial. It may sound like we ask a lot of journalists. But really, asking one more question would\u2019ve turned this story around: How far along is this idea? The answer leads us to look beyond the novelty, beyond the theoretical benefits, beyond the entangled claims of the institution and inventor who stand to benefit, and see, simply, whether this idea is better or worse or needs 4 more years in the oven before we can even ask. Mammography isn\u2019t perfect, and an improved screening technique for breast cancer could reduce pain, suffering, and death for many women. But that need doesn\u2019t give journalists a license to hype.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9113,"claim":"Nanoparticles loaded with component of common spice kill cancer cells","explanation":"This University of Central Florida news release covers a study published in the journal Nanoscale, which found that curcumin-loaded nanoparticles kill neuroblastoma tumor cells in cell culture (in test tubes or petri dishes). Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice tumeric. The news release doesn\u2019t disclose any harms and quantitative data to back up its claims and, instead, uses only broad, ambiguous language when describing the treatment\u2019s benefits. For example, researchers found that these molecules may induce \u201csubstantial\u201d cell death in neuroblastoma cells without being toxic to healthy cells. The study\u2019s limitations should have been emphasized \u2014 namely, that it\u2019s early pre-clinical research with experiments only conducted in undefined cell lines. In addition, research with curcumin-loaded nanoparticles isn\u2019t exactly new. In 2012, a couple of studies looked at the molecule\u2019s effects, including its toxicity, on neuroblastoma cells. Many news releases cover research that is in its pre-clinical phases. This is fair game, of course, but we then expect these reports to caution readers on the treatment\u2019s applicability to clinical medicine. In other words, treatments that are successful in cell lines and animal models usually do not translate to effective clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it also takes years, maybe decades, before a treatment is even ready for clinical trials \u2014 a process often referred to as \u201cfrom bench to bedside.\u201d To avoid giving patients false hope, news releases need to disclose the early nature of the research high up in the release as well as be more explicit in detailing the treatment\u2019s development and timeline.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11229,"claim":"Pre and Post Testing Show Reversal of Memory Loss From Alzheimer\u2019s Disease in Ten Patients","explanation":"This is a news release about an update of a small 2014 study on a program to reverse cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The program includes as many as 36 interventions which must be followed. Right out of the starting gate the release misinforms by using the terms mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s disease interchangeably. They are not the same. The study reports \u201cunprecedented\u201d improvement in 10 patients with \u201cearly Alzheimer\u2019s (AD) or its precursors\u201d who adhered to the protocol, dubbed \u201cmetabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration,\u201d or MEND, for five to 24 months. All but one of the patients had genes (APOE) associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. The news release provides data on just three of the cases in the study and does not discuss costs or potential challenges of adhering to this protocol. The news release reveals that the developer of the program, University of California, Los Angeles neurology professor Dale Bredesen, M.D., has a deal to publish a book for lay readers in 2017. Moreover, researchers say their findings are strong enough to warrant widespread genetic testing so those at risk for the disease can receive preventive measures. The book deal and the recommendation of genetic testing are troubling since there are just a handful of case studies to back up the program. Bredesen himself is quoted in the news release acknowledging the need for large-scale clinical trials. But the minor use of cautious language in describing the study as \u201csmall\u201d and the call for future larger trials do not make up for the intentional muddying of the symptoms of age-related memory loss and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As the news release points out, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a huge and growing problem, affecting 5.4 million Americans and creating an economic burden on the health care system. No medications are available to stop its progress. There\u2019s evidence that non-drug interventions that are designed to fight inflammation and improve blood sugar regulation like those in the MEND program could be effective. The MEND program includes the elimination of processed foods, regular exercise, yoga and medication to reduce stress, melatonin to extend sleep, supplements such as fish oil, vitamins D3 and B12, and hormone replacement therapy. However, the MEND treatment protocol involves so many factors it may be difficult to determine which ones are effective. To date nothing has been proven to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s. Medications are available but they are expensive, may delay progression marginally, and have side effects.","label":"false"}

This brief article explains why a certain subset of people who have strokes may be treated more effectively with a new procedure than with existing alternatives. The new procedure sends a thin wire tube through their blood vessels to the location of a clot in the brain and removes it. The story did an excellent job of listing the complex criteria required to find the patients for whom this procedure is now recommended. It could have provided more specifics about the benefits associated with the procedure and its costs. And one of the experts tapped for commentary is a paid consultant to companies who make the devices used in this procedure, and the story should have alerted readers to that fact. The new guidelines are the result of months of study by a committee of the American Heart Association. Implementation of these guidelines will require much more systematic coordination of stroke care than currently exists. Currently, smaller community hospitals can quickly assess a patient, get an imaging study, and start tPA (clot-busting medication delivered by IV) within an hour or two after symptoms begin. But to assess eligibility for endovascular clot retrieval (the procedure discussed here), and transport patients to centers that provide the highly specialized procedures, could take time. There is good-quality evidence that such coordination of stroke care would produce clinically important benefits, but the logistical and cost challenges that have yet to be addressed are significant.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11332,"claim":"Researchers Develop Simple Paper Test That Quickly Diagnoses Illnesses by Changing Colour","explanation":"Paper diagnostic test strip. Image: McMaster UniversityThis news release reports on the development of paper test strips that amplify DNA or RNA from blood, sweat or urine and determine if the person taking the test has a disease. The strips are made of a polymeric sugar film integrated with the paper device. Once a sample is applied the paper changes color to indicate the presence of a marker for a \u201cspecific bacterium, virus, or even cancer,\u201d according to the release. The researchers quoted in the release claim that these test strips can be easily and inexpensively manufactured and, because they are portable, could be used to diagnose or self-diagnose illness (such as Ebola) in remote areas before the subject even knows they are ill. But the release does not make clear how such a test could be used to diagnose and differentiate between the multitudes of different diseases and conditions that afflict humans. Besides skirting other important details such as ballpark cost of the strips and data backing up claimed benefits, the release doesn\u2019t put the paper test in context. While the idea of a \u201csimple\u201d paper test to check for illness may sound novel to the public, paper diagnostic tools have been under development since at least 2007. Some diseases are contagious long before the patient has any symptoms. If a person could be diagnosed as contagious in an asymptomatic stage, then the spread of infection could be slowed or halted. A rapid test allowing patients tested in a clinic to know before they left if they had influenza or a cold, strep or a viral sore throat, would be advantageous because it would allow faster targeted treatments. Because such a diagnostic tools are predicted to be relatively inexpensive, portable, and easy to use, they might also hold enormous potential for helping health professionals in the developing world to quickly and accurately diagnose and treat disease.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9990,"claim":"Immunotherapy Drug Becomes First Therapy Approved by FDA for Rare Skin Cancer","explanation":"A new drug approval offers an opportunity to review the evidence with readers. This news release from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center about a newly approved drug for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare type of skin cancer, missed that chance. We understand the need to get the news out there and even to highlight a patient story, but there is enough evidence on benefits and risks associated with immunotherapy, not to mention costs, that news releases should give readers a fuller picture. Without that important information, the dramatic experience of the cancer patient in the release provides an overly optimistic picture of patient outcomes for everyone who may be diagnosed with this particular type of cancer. MCC is a rare, often aggressive type of skin cancer, with about 1,500 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. The 5-year survival rate for MCC is estimated at around 60 percent, according to MayoClinic.org. This is the first drug approved for treating MCC \u2014 but not the only recognized treatment for the disease. Some of the media interest in the approval relates to the rapidity with which the FDA approved it while awarding the drug several special designations \u2014 accelerated approval, priority review, breakthrough therapy and orphan drug status, the latter of which \u201cprovides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases,\u201d according to the FDA\u2019s news release on the approval. Readers should keep in mind that the evidence for the drug is limited and based on a small study of short duration.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":10620,"claim":"Landmark clinical trial shows gene-targeted drug can treat prostate cancer","explanation":"This small phase ll study looked at responses to the drug olarparib, and its action on a particular type of prostate tumor mutation. While the news release indicates that this is pioneering work in the field of personalized prostate cancer treatment, there is still much to be skeptical about the practice of isolating cancer-related genes with\u00a0new targeted drugs. The key point not made in the news release is that the study did not demonstrate any mortality or survival benefit in the act of identifying and targeting men with mutated prostate tumors and giving them\u00a0olarparib. The news release comes across somewhat as a promotional vehicle for genetic testing and yet comparing it with the test for BRAC (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutation would tend to give it a gloss it might not deserve. Without\u00a0results with this form of\u00a0 \u201cprecision medicine,\u201d hyping genetic testing around this type of metastatic prostate cancer feels a little irresponsible. The final line: \u201cUnderstanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families\u201d seems to be\u00a0putting the cart way before the horse and is likely to confuse and build unreasonable expectations among prostate cancer sufferers. Many men still die from prostate cancer and if there were an easy genetic test that could pinpoint which prostate cancer sufferers were most likely to benefit from a targeted drug therapy this could be a huge advance. The news release presents hype and hope yet one has to refer to the\u00a0published study to find any real information, where the researchers report: \u201cWe cannot yet determine whether olaparib improves overall survival among patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and DNA-repair defects.\u201d","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10592,"claim":"New hormone therapy sparks debate","explanation":"The story presents bioidentical hormones as a new option for relieving bothersome symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, cold sweats and vaginal discomfort. The story accurately reports that the active ingredients of these supposedly \u201cnatural\u201d hormones are the same ones used in synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, these hormones are not as well-regulated or well-tested as synthetic versions. The story provides no evidence that bioidentical hormones are more effective or safer than traditional HRT. Positive testimonials from a physician employee of a bioidentical hormone supplier, a celebrity and women who have experienced reduced menopausal symptoms with\u00a0 bioidentical hormones are not a substitute for quantitative evidence. The comment that a hormone product can be tailored to a woman's chemistry is not proven. Additionally, the story does not mention the cost of bioidenticals, which are typically about $50\/month, similar to the cost of conventional HRT. Any physician can provide a prescription for bioidentical hormones in a routine office visit. The story appropriately stresses that menopause is a natural part of aging and not a disease which necessitates medical intervention. The story also mentions that short-term use of HRT in any form should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause. While the bioindentical hormones are marketed as a natural alternative to balancing hormones and easing bothersome symptoms of hormonal fluctuations during menopause, the story fails to mention the least risky \u201cnatural\u201d interventions for managing symptoms of menopause, such as exercise and wearing loose, cool clothing to prevent discomfort from hot flashes and cold sweats. The story also does not mention non-hormonal, evidence-based pharmaceutical options for managing symptoms. However, using these medications for treatment of hot flashes would be considered an off-label prescription. (See a previous review of a story on this topic.)","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9702,"claim":"Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows","explanation":"This story is about a large retrospective study that was published this week in the journal JAMA Surgery. The research suggests women who opted for surgery to treat their breast cancer had better survival rates than those who didn\u2019t, even though the number of surgeries has plunged from 1988 to 2011. This Washington Post report does many things well: It quantifies the benefits of breast surgery in absolute terms, points out the study\u2019s limitations and doesn\u2019t make sweeping recommendations based on this research. Furthermore, the story uses cautionary language, making readers really question whether surgery is the better option for stage 4 breast cancer patients. It also incorporates two independent sources who provide some critical perspectives, such as the two other small studies that showed no correlation between surgery and survival in this group of women. We would have liked to have seen more discussion on the harms of breast surgeries, as well as the existing therapies for breast cancer patients. And we would have liked for the report to have pointed out that usually younger women underwent surgery in the study, which may have affected the results. Overall, however, the Washington Post puts forth a thorough, nuanced story based on the latest findings. Though current screening recommendations for breast cancer are intended to identify cancers at an earlier, more curable stage of disease, women still present with metastatic disease (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). This can occur because of not having screening or\u00a0not having it regularly enough, or it may relate to aggressive disease that develops and metastasizes prior to it being detected on standard imaging tests. For those women with metastatic disease, particularly younger ones, cure and thus long-term survival is uncommon. The question addressed in this story is whether the addition of surgery to standard aggressive therapy \u2013 generally chemotherapy and radiation treatment \u2013 leads to longer survival. The story does a good job of describing the benefit seen in this retrospective study as well as highlighting its limitations. Specifically, there is no evidence from higher quality, prospective studies that surgery provides additional survival benefit. Clearly such studies are needed and the article suggests that such studies are currently underway. The challenge is what to recommend for women who currently face this treatment decision. The simple answer is that we don\u2019t really know and the article does a good job of not overselling surgery based upon the results of this study.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10173,"claim":"An implant that hits a nerve","explanation":"Urinary incontinence is a significant health problem that is frequently unrecognized or untreated in many older adults. While the prevalence of incontinence increases with age this does not mean it is part of the normal aging process and many older adults may be unaware that it is a treatable condition. There is good quality evidence that behavior and lifestyle modification, some medications, and\/or surgery can improve or resolve urinary incontinence. In 2001, the FDA approved the InterStim sacral nerve stimulation system for the treatment of urge incontinence. Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation for urge incontinence appears adequate to support the use of this procedure, however patient selection is important. The diagnosis should be defined as clearly as possible and the procedure limited to patients who have not responded to conservative treatments. The story refers to a review that found 4 randomized, controlled trials of the device. The story could have provided more detail about the strength of these studies and pointed out the limitations on the current evidence, such as the small sample sizes, limited follow up time and whether these studies were funded by the device manufacturer. However, the story fell short in quantifying the benefits of treatment. The story provides some quantification of benefits of the device but leaves many questions unanswered. The story states that 80% of the patients experienced at least a 50% improvement in symptoms with the device. Compared to how many with conventional treatment? What does an \"improvement\" mean? In what symptoms? How was improvement measured?","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":11346,"claim":"Easy Nondrug Help Aids ADHD Kids","explanation":"Might behavioral therapy help preschoolers diagnosed with ADHD improve their ability to learn and reduce problem behaviors? If it does, is an intensive, customized intervention more helpful than a simpler educational program? This brief article suggests the answers are yes and no. Using a reasonable range of sources, the story nicely sums up the new research and the problems faced by preschoolers with ADHD. The news story says ADHD may afflict a small portion of preschoolers (1% to 4%). But the wide net cast by the story\u2019s diagnostic criteria could ensnare some innocent victims\u2014\u201cextreme symptoms when compared to youngsters of the same age,\u201d including kids who don\u2019t listen, who \u201cdrive their families crazy,\u201d and who are injury-prone.

The article explains that the main treatment option, medication, is not yet approved for these youngsters.

{"claim_id":11220,"claim":"Laser-Based Dermatological Procedures Could Be Revolutionized with New Techniqu","explanation":"This news release claims that a device being developed at the University of Missouri could revolutionize treatment to remove tattoos, birth marks and port-wine stains based only on a test on some pig skin\u2026and that pig didn\u2019t even have any tattoos or other markings. The release quotes a researcher who hopes \u201cthe procedure will be available widely in the near future.\u201d But there\u2019s no evidence to support that statement either. While the release is peppered with claims that this device that combines laser light with ultrasound pulses will be safer and more effective, that\u2019s not what the experiment tested. The researchers showed only that their device was able to push more laser light through a piece of pig skin than a conventional laser. Their assumption that increasing transmitted optical power will improve clinical effectiveness has yet to be tested. Neither benefits nor harms are put in numerical context. Alternatives are not mentioned. We applaud the release writers for including a link to a patent application, which provides more detail about the device and highlights potential benefits to the researchers. The release notes that the work was funded by a program to support commercialization of academic research. There are objective statements about research results, and then there are marketing statements in support of a product. This research was supported by a University of Missouri\u2019s FastTrack grant. According to the university\u2019s web site, such grants \u201care not to be used for basic research, but to evaluate the commercial potential of existing research.\u201d But when journalists and others receive a news release from University of Missouri Health they should be able to trust that academic standards hold more sway than marketing interests.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9253,"claim":"Discovery offers prospect of shorter treatment and cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia","explanation":"This news release by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is a teaser on a potential new drug target for sufferers of a blood cancer called\u00a0chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML, which affects 30,000 Americans a year. The release spends a good amount of space explaining the condition and problems with a standard treatment\u00a0\u2014 a drug called\u00a0Gleevec (a brand-name version of the drug imatinib) \u2014 and how up to 90% of patients with the disease face a lifetime of medication that may eventually stop working. It also does a nice job explaining a\u00a0biological pathway that helps drive CML and why it might be a mechanism to target in the\u00a0future, specifically\u00a0Ezh2 inhibitors. However, the study was done in mice \u2014 not people. The release belatedly points\u00a0this out in the final third of the text \u2014 but we would have liked to see it more prominently mentioned. The reason: The relevance may not transfer to people with CML. That\u2019s also why\u00a0we think the repeated use of the word \u201ccure\u201d and the possibility of shorter treatment in the headline is overstating and misleading. One glaring omission was that of price. The only allusion to price in the news release is an aside in the closing line noting shorter treatment times translate into cost savings. We\u2019re also given no rough treatment cost estimates for an unnamed Ezh2 inhibitor made by Epizyme that\u2019s mentioned in the release. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) develops in bone marrow and affects myeloid cells. Those cells typically mature into platelets or red blood cells, but genetic and other abnormalities can lead them to mature into defunct granulocyte cells, i.e. leukemia. CML patients experience a gradual though sometimes rapid\u00a0build-up of leukemia in their bones and then in their spleen,\u00a0crowding out healthy cells over time. This drives\u00a0symptoms that may include frequent infections (due to immune system weakening), fatigue (fewer red blood cells), and easy bleeding (fewer platelets). CML affects about\u00a030,000 people each year and about 1.2 million to 1.5 million people worldwide, most of them middle-aged adults (though there are a few children). While patients who seek the standard of treatment \u2014 imatinib (marketed as Gleevec and Glivec) \u2014 receive it \u201cindefinitely,\u201d the median survival is between 5-6 years, since leukemia cells can build up resistance to\u00a0imatinib-like drugs. In fact, about\u00a080-90% of patients can\u2019t clear all of their leukemia cells and stay on permanent drugs. By increasing the number of CML patients who can drive their cancer into remission, suffering could be dramatically reduced \u2014 as would the cost of their treatment. As teased by this release, Ezh2 inhibitors\u00a0may (or may not) help CML patients. Clinical trials would have to determine if that hypothesis pans out.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10385,"claim":"Aspirin may cut cancer deaths, but caution urged","explanation":"From the appropriate title to the last precautionary sentence, this story provides the readers with a balanced perspective and places the study into context. This story gives readers key facts and a range of expert reactions and context about a study that re-analyzed heart disease prevention experiments and saw lower rates of cancer deaths among trial participants who had been assigned to take daily low-dose aspirin. Readers are clearly told that while this study provides new insight, there are some key questions that need to be answered before many experts would change their recommendations about aspirin. The only important shortcoming is that it reports only the relative risk reductions without also telling readers about the absolute differences in cancer death rates that the researchers observed. Cancers of all types are second only to heart disease as the cause of death in developed countries. A number of observational studies have suggested that the kind of low-dose aspirin regimen recommended for some people at risk of heart disease may also have some cancer-related benefits. This study attempts to avoid some of the inherent limitations of observational studies by using data that was collected as part of experimental trials that randomized people to take aspirin or a placebo pill. It is important that stories explain both the advantages and limitations of this kind of data analysis.","label":"true"}

The device has received clearance from the FDA in a letter stating the device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to existing devices already in use.

The finding described in the news release only applied to mice being fed a high fat diet (45 percent from fat), whereas when on normal chow and intermittent fasting on normal chow, there wasn\u2019t much difference.

{"claim_id":11128,"claim":"Experimental Psoriasis Drug Bests Older Treatment","explanation":"But neither story disclosed the conflicts of interest of the principal investigator. It\u2019s difficult sometimes for journalists to dig and find conflicts of interest in those making claims about health care interventions. But when the conflicts are disclosed and published for anyone to see, why would a news story fail to include that information in a story? And neither story discussed the costs of biolgic drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. These drugs can cost $1,500-2,000\/month. We think that any discussion about a new drug should include some comment about costs. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that, in its more aggressive forms, can produce a good deal of discomfort and disfigurement. Treatments to date have improved but a mainstay drug, methotrexate, is limited in its effectiveness and can have some nasty side effects. Biologic drugs such as Stelara, Humira and Enbrel are somewhat more effective but very expensive.

{"claim_id":10497,"claim":"Are You At Risk? 5 Different Types of Prostate Cancer Found","explanation":"This news release puts readers in a worried, defensive posture right from the get-go with its headline, \u201cAre you at risk?\u201d It concludes with a pitch for the services of robotic prostate cancer surgeon and urologic oncologist Dr. David Samadi of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. In between, it briefly recaps a study published in the EBioMedicine journal that apparently discovered \u201cfive different types of prostate cancer\u201d (the study characterizes this finding, much more soberly, as\u00a0\u201cfive separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles\u201d). The release suggests that genetic testing used in the study is better than current methods at forecasting prostate cancer progression; however, this apparent benefit is never quantified and key limitations of the study are never addressed. The tone is promotional, with links to a Fox news program featuring the surgeon quoted, a link to a \u201cProstateCancer911\u201d website and the surgeon\u2019s phone number for making an appointment for a consult. The study seems secondary at best. About 220,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States annually, according to the American Cancer Society. The vast majority (98 percent) live at least 10 years after diagnosis and 94 percent are alive 15 years after diagnosis. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, the risk for death increases. This study highlights the possibility that men with high-risk gene profiles would be candidates for more aggressive follow-up treatment following removal of their prostates. The discussion also makes it clear that the value of these risk categories for clinical care remains to be determined. The news release would have done well to communicate that uncertainty more clearly.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":10798,"claim":"New hope for macular degeneration","explanation":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common and potentially devastating eye disorder. There are two major types of AMD, \u201cdry\u201d and \u201cwet\u201d. \u201cDry\u201d AMD is by far the more common type, but it progresses very slowly. \u201cWet\u201d or neovascular AMD, is less common, but the onset is very sudden and can progress quickly to blindness. The recent FDA approval of the drug Lucentis and the publication of two studies on Lucentis in this week\u2019s New England Journal of Medicine bring new information to patients with neovascular AMD. While the clinical trial results are promising, the extremely high cost of the drug (around $2000 a month) may be unaffordable for many patients and could place a great strain on Medicare, which would cover 80% of the cost. Furthermore, there are currently no studies showing how Lucentis compares to a very similar drug, Avastin, which is not approved for used in AMD, but is frequently used off-label for the condition and which costs much less. This story does a decent job of describing the new developments, but missed an opportunity to explain the controversy surrounding the use of Avastin. The story clearly states that Lucentis was recently approved by the FDA. The story should have been more clear that the approval was for neovascular, or \u201cwet\u201d, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and not the more common \u201cdry\u201d form of AMD. The story does states that the cost of the drug is about $2000 a month. However, the story should have provided more context by comparing this cost to the cost of other treatments for AMD. The story could have been more clear about the difference between the \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d forms of the disease. Although the story mentions two studies, this is not enough information on the strength of the available evidence. Specifically, there have been no studies comparing the effectiveness of Lucentis to Avastin. The story provides estimates of benefit for the drug group only. The story should have given the estimates of benefit for both the drug group and the control group. Furthermore, the story only quotes one expert. The story should have quoted other researchers or clinicians who could provide more context.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10785,"claim":"Prozac Failed Anorexic Women in Study","explanation":"This story reports the results of a small study of fluoxetine (trade name Prozac) for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Fluoxetine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of bulimia nervosa; evidence for fluoxetine as a treatment for anorexia is less clear, and results from this study suggest no apparent benefit. The story mentions that fluoxetine is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153often used to treat anorexia\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, but this is an off-label use, which is not mentioned. It\u2019s an important fact to include. The medication is more commonly prescribed for anorexic patients to treat depression and\/or obsessive-compulsive disorder, common co-existing mental illnesses in these patients. The story partially describes the study design, but does not mention it was a double-blind, randomized study. The story provides absolute numbers of patients who completed the year-long study and maintained their weight. The story also appropriately notes that the difference in weight maintenance and time to relapse between the fluoxetine group and placebo group was not statistically significant. This was a small study, with less than half of the patients completing treatment, so the results may not be generalizable, especially for patients at earlier and less acute stages of anorexia. The patients in this study were recruited from eating disorders treatment centers and had been suffering with anorexia for several years (average was 4 years). The story mentions that one teenage study participant attempted suicide. Adolescent suicide has been linked to certain anti-depressant medications, including fluoxetine. No other harms or side effects of the drug are mentioned. Even though the source journal article did not list negative side effects of fluoxetine, that doesn\u2019t remove the obligation to discuss these as part of a complete and balanced story. Lastly, the story provides several sources of information from researchers and clinicians not affiliated with the study to provide perspective on this study and the available treatment options for anorexia, a mental illness that some consider treatment-resistant. The story mentions behavioral treatments for anorexia, which have been somewhat effective, and notes that the study participants received psychotherapy (in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy) and medication.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11327,"claim":"Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women May Reduce Alzheimer\u2019s Risk","explanation":"A small pilot study has found that giving recently postmenopausal women estrogen via a patch is associated with reduced depositions of amyloid in the brain (a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease) relative to women who received estrogen orally or who took a placebo. Additionally, the study found that the association was strongest among women with a greater genetic risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The study was carefully done, and the news release offers some useful details about the study\u2019s methods. However, the study included just 68 women, too few to make the patterns found reliable. To its credit, the release quotes the lead author about the need for larger replications. But\u00a0that begs the question of why the Mayo Clinic seeks to publicize this work at all, particularly with a news release headline that emphasizes disease reduction potential, when the study only looked at amyloid levels, a risk marker. There is very active debate as to whether lowering amyloid will have any impact on actual symptoms or rates of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A better headline might have been: \u201cPilot Study Suggests Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women Reduces Amyloid, Marker of Alzheimer\u2019s Risk.\u201d Journalists certainly deserve to know about this study, but they need to keep it\u00a0in their back pockets until more rigorous clinical studies have been done. Whether estrogen replacement therapy is of value to postmenopausal women is contested territory, and researchers, including those in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study from which this research stems, are trying to explore the contingencies, if any,\u00a0that distinguish women who could benefit from estrogen supplementation from those who may not. This study adds to a body of work looking at the \u201ctiming hypothesis,\u201d that is, the notion that\u00a0estrogen has different effects in the heart and brain when given to younger postmenopausal woman compared to women in their 60s or 70s. Studies of effects on the heart using intermediate disease markers (carotid artery thickness, analogous to heart disease in the way that amyloid deposition is to Alzheimer disease) in lieu of clinical outcomes (heart attacks, cognitive impairment) have been appearing in journals over the past two years. Considered in this context, the research is of interest but needs to be shared with a strong dose of qualifiers.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10484,"claim":"Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment","explanation":"This story explores the controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, that purportedly treats multiple sclerosis. The story\u2019s\u00a0emphasis on skeptical perspectives\u00a0is appropriate for a treatment that hasn\u2019t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a \u201cmiracle\u201d recovery following\u00a0the procedure, the writer\u00a0defies convention and focuses\u00a0on the disappointed patient who didn\u2019t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate\u00a0caution,\u00a0the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions,\u00a0but it never provides a run down of\u00a0what kinds of studies have been performed and what they\u2019ve found so\u00a0far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected. The problem is that in the desperate search for a cure, patients, family and providers can seek out risky and expensive treatments that haven\u2019t been adequately studied.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":13529,"claim":"California\u2019s Prop 55 \"prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools.","explanation":"The Yes on 55 campaign claimed in recent ads that \"Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools.\" There would certainly be less money for schools if the tax extension fails. But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55\u2019s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate. But they leave the impression that the measure\u2019s failure will lead to deep school cuts much sooner. And that\u2019s not the case.","label":"false"}

To its credit, the story cautions that this is not anywhere close to being a readily available treatment. However, it neglects significant potential harms of using an implantable device and isn\u2019t completely clear on the lack of a proven benefit. We think this study was one of those that isn\u2019t quite ready for a consumer news audience; it\u2019s just too preliminary and has the potential to stoke false hope. Authors of this study point out that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not just a memory problem but rather presents a host of cognitive and behavioral impairments, and even \u201csmall treatment advances\u201d could have a meaningful impact by delaying their progress.

{"claim_id":9189,"claim":"FDA approves new psoriasis drug","explanation":"The US Food and Drug Administration just approved a new drug to treat psoriasis, a common skin condition that can form thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches. Siliq (brodalumab) is mainly intended for patients who don\u2019t respond to other forms of treatment, like\u00a0anti-inflammatory topical medications and light therapies. The \u201clast resort\u201d recommendation may be due to the four completed suicides that took place during the clinical trial, leading the FDA to believe that Siliq may be correlated to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior \u2014 especially in patients with a history of depression. As a result, the FDA is requiring Siliq to be sold with a \u201cboxed warning\u201d (the strictest warning put in the labeling of prescription drugs) and only through a restricted program. The FDA news release devotes a significant chunk to the drug\u2019s potential harms and makes clear who should or shouldn\u2019t be taking Siliq. What\u2019s mainly missing from the release are any numbers to give a sense of the scope of potential benefits and harms. Regarding the drug\u2019s potential benefits, the release uses only vague, comparative wording (\u201cmore patients\u2026 had skin that was clear or almost clear.\u201d). We don\u2019t know how the participants were selected, how long they were followed up and how their improvement was assessed. Furthermore, a clinical trial was stopped for a period of time due to safety concerns, which was then continued by another drug manufacturer. Although not explicitly stated, it is fair to assume that drug manufacturers also funded these clinical trials. These are study limitations that were never disclosed by the news release. We did find a 90-page FDA briefing document online from 2016, which includes some efficacy data. Curiously, this document mentions five clinical trials instead of three. We\u2019re not sure why the FDA release didn\u2019t include the two other clinical trials that compared Siliq (brodalumab) to ustekinumab. We also reviewed TIME.com\u2019s coverage of this new drug. Specialty drugs treating skin conditions like psoriasis can be expensive. The main competitors to Valeant\u2019s Siliq may\u00a0be Novartis\u2019 Cosentyx and Eli Lilly\u2019s Taltz \u2014 both of which cost at least $16,600 for one dose. Although some of this could be covered by insurance, patients could still be responsible for co-pays, which could amount to thousands of dollars. In addition, if patients have exhausted all existing treatment options and are desperate to clear up their psoriasis, they may be willing to try riskier therapies. If there is a new alternative that is FDA-approved and cost-effective, then it certainly deserves to be reported \u2014 as in this case, with strong caveats.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9156,"claim":"City of Hope researchers find regular use of aspirin can lower risk of breast cancer for women","explanation":"The release focuses on a recent paper published in the journal Breast Cancer Research, which addresses breast cancer risk and regular use of aspirin in low doses. While the release states that low doses of aspirin \u201creduces the risk of breast cancer in women,\u201d there are problems with how the information is presented. Specifically, it\u2019s impossible to know whether the aspirin affected breast cancer risk based on this study. That\u2019s because this was an observational study \u2014 meaning that it could detect a correlation between aspirin use and breast cancer, but not whether the use of aspirin was actually responsible for lower rates of breast cancer. That\u2019s a key distinction. Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women in the United States and is diagnosed in hundreds of thousands of women each year. That means many thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of women and their loved ones are on the lookout for things they can do to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Telling the public that aspirin reduces cancer risk has the potential to influence the daily decisions of those women, which is problematic when the relevant study is unable to make that determination. What\u2019s more, daily aspirin use can cause or exacerbate other health problems, which this release does not address at all.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9589,"claim":"Fish Oil Has Benefits After a Heart Attack: Study","explanation":"In a randomized controlled trial studying fish oil versus placebo, a very modest improvement in heart health markers was observed in people prescribed fish oil. This TIME article demonstrates a good understanding of the study\u2019s novelty, which appears to be among the first\u00a0to look at potential benefits of fish oil in patients who have just had a\u00a0heart attack. However, the story missed the mark in several ways: It didn\u2019t mention the potential harms of taking fish oil if you\u2019re a post-heart attack patient, nor did it discuss costs of the intervention. The only person quoted is the lead researcher of the study\u2013an independent source was needed. Lastly, several limitations of the study are not discussed, including that many patients did not return for post-treatment follow-up. Fish oil is a widely used health supplement. Notwithstanding dozens of rigorous studies that\u00a0cast doubt on its actual health benefits, the\u00a0popularity of fish oil supplements remains unabated. Most studies have looked at the preventive benefits of fish oil in high-risk populations. The study reported here, on the other hand, examines the protective benefits of fish oil in patients right after a heart attack. The results suggest that high doses of fish oil after a heart attack may have modest benefits, based on measurements of things like scarring and heart function, which are surrogate markers. News coverage ideally points out this fact\u2013that these\u00a0markers can\u2019t tell us if fish oil actually\u00a0reduces the risk of a\u00a0repeat heart attack, death or other cardiac event.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10229,"claim":"Lung Cancer Breath \u2018Signature\u2019 Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis","explanation":"Image courtesy University of LouisvilleThis release discusses a study testing the efficacy of a test using the breath of lung cancer patients. Since patients with lung cancer are known to have specific chemicals in their breath \u2014 known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \u2014 which are caused by the disease, detecting them after the patients underwent surgery could indicate a recurrence of the disease. These chemicals are, in effect, markers for the presence of disease. The release notes the study showed a reduction in the amount of these compounds after patients had undergone surgical resection of the lung, but doesn\u2019t give any numerical information about the level of reduction, other than to say it is \u201csignificant.\u201d The release provides a nice description of costs and describes the test\u2019s potential benefit to reduce harm from repeat CTs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States with 224,000 new diagnoses each year and 158,000 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Both early detection and successful monitoring of disease recurrence might reduce those numbers considerably. Current monitoring for lung cancer recurrence after surgery is based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. A breath test using chemical markers to detect recurrence could potentially be cheaper, simpler and less risky than repeat CT scans. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that a positive breath test would still necessitate a follow-up CT scan and with almost every screening test, there is a risk of missed diagnosis.","label":"MISLEADING"}

This release from MD Anderson Cancer Center avoids the worst excesses and we liked much of what was written, including the description of the study design and quantification of the survival benefit. But some important omissions are evident. We can perhaps forgive the release for not including a discussion of cost. But there were other significant deficiencies, including lack of a meaningful discussion on potential harms of the treatment, no mention of the study funding source, and no disclosure that the principal investigator (quoted extensively in the release) is a consultant to the manufacturer of nivolumab.

It says that the cream appears to reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinomas among the elderly veterans in the trial by 75 percent, although it has no statistically significant effect on reducing basal cell carcinomas.

{"claim_id":11172,"claim":"Using PET Scans to Discover Early Signs of Alzheimer\u2019s","explanation":"Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a common and tragic disease. In spite of much research, there is currently little that can be done to stop or slow its progression. A hot area of research is in early detection. Two years ago, Medicare decided to cover PET scanning for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s, with the hope that it could help with treatment and allow patients and their families to help with future planning. However, Medicare\u2019s decision was very controversial and there are many issues surrounding the use of PET scanning for this conditon. This story does little to enlighten readers and is flawed in several ways. The story does not attempt to quantify the benefits of PET scanning. Most importantly, the story does not mention that even if Alzheimer\u2019s is detected early, there is not much that can be done for it. The drug Aricept has only minor effects on the progression of the disease. Although the story mentions neurologic exams, the advantages and disadvantages of PET scanning compared to existing approaches are not described. How will the scanning fit in with current practice? These questions are not answered in the story. The story does not comment on the novelty or availability of PET scanning. Although the story hints at false alarms, this is insufficient information on the harms of scanning. How do such \u201cfalse alarms\u201d impact peoples\u2019 lives? The story does quote two directors of major Alzheimer\u2019s research centers. The story could have quoted other clinicians or researchers who could have provided some additional perspective. By accurately describing the prevalence of Alzheimer\u2019s, the story avoids disease mongering. The story does mention that the scans are expensive \u2013 $1000 to $3500 and are not necessarily covered by insurance. The story could have provided costs of the traditional neurologic exam by comparison.","label":"false"}

And while the study failed to demonstrate benefit in management of knee OA, the article included a quote from a patient who uses the supplements and believes they are effective (though whether the individual has knee OA is not clear). Thus the story seems to balance one individual anecdote against the weight of evidence from a study of 1,583 people.

{"claim_id":10665,"claim":"Timely use of Novartis' Entresto could prevent or postpone over 28,000 US deaths per year among HFrEF patients, according to an expert analysis in JAMA Cardiology","explanation":"This news release summarizes a study that estimated the benefits of sacubitril\/valsartan (marketed as Entresto) vs enalapril (an ACE-inhibitor) in treating heart failure patients with lowered ejection fraction (the amount of blood pumped from the heart). In the study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology, researchers created a statistical model that estimated that about 28,000 patients per year with heart failure and a lowered ejection fraction could benefit from Entresto, a twice-daily pill approved in 2015. The model found that patients on Entresto lived a year longer, on average, than those treated with enalapril, and that the medication was \u201ccost effective\u201d when used with concurrent standard therapies. The release from the drugmaker, Novartis, describes their complex analysis and highlights their conclusion that the heart failure medication is cost effective. But the release does not include any discussion of the extremely high cost of the drug. An estimated 6 million people in the United States have heart failure, and about half of those with heart failure also have reduced ejection fraction, so any treatment for them matters for their individual health and for society\u2019s costs of overall health treatment. The release states that the analysis reinforces a strong recommendation from several medical societies that the condition be treated with sacubitril\/valsartan. This release about the statistical model of effectiveness for the drug Entresto claims that it could delay or prevent thousands of deaths per year, but does not include analysis that the total cost of treating the majority of those eligible could drastically tax the health system.

{"claim_id":9355,"claim":"Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too","explanation":"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together. But does one cause the other? In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period. The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one. Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant. Maintaining cognitive capacity is a major goal for aging individuals, so anything that contributes to that objective is worth attention. If eye health indeed proves to be a substantial contributor, that will ramp up attention to diagnostic and treatment options. But such behavior awaits more robust studies, and stories about this link need to tread cautiously.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9921,"claim":"Omega-3 Fatty Acids May Lower Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Obese Women","explanation":"This release describes the results of a study testing whether omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer in obese women by reducing the density of their breast tissue. Higher breast tissue density is recognized as a marker for increased breast cancer risk. The study involved a small group of women who received the omega-3 fatty acid, the omega-3 in tandem with a chemo-preventative drug Raloxifene, the drug alone, or no treatment at all. According to the release, at the end of two years, women considered obese (their body mass index \u2014 BMI \u2014 was greater than 29) showed a reduction in breast tissue density, which the researchers argued reduced their cancer risk. However, this is misleading. This finding is from a small subgroup of obese women within the already-small study. The main finding of the study \u2014 which is never even mentioned in the news release \u2014 is that the supplement had no impact on reducing high breast density whether taken alone or in tandem with Raloxifene. The release also omitted projected costs and harms of the prescription-only supplement used in the study. The American Cancer Society predicts that 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women this year and that more than 40,000 women will die from this disease. Easy actions that women can take to prevent this disease, or at least reduce their risk of getting it, are of almost universal interest to the public. If it is shown that taking a readily available supplement like omega-3 fatty acids will reduce breast cancer risk in obese women, that\u2019s information that will be of wide interest.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9331,"claim":"Amarin fish oil capsule shows dramatic benefit for cardiovascular patients, potentially upending market","explanation":"A 25% reduction in cardiovascular events, including death, heart attack or stroke sounds like a big deal\u2026 and maybe it is. But this story about the results of a trial of a prescription drug derived from fish oil (brand name Vascepa) relies on a news release and company statements that don\u2019t provide basic information about the precise number or type of cardiovascular events observed by researchers. Without absolute numbers, it is impossible to judge the importance of these results. It is also premature to claim that the results represent \u201cheart-medicine history,\u201d especially given that the findings haven\u2019t been peer-reviewed and are at odds with numerous previous studies. The story takes a cheerleading tone and fails to supply key context. For example, it highlights a dramatic quote from a researcher without noting that he was paid over $120,000 by the drug company, including payments for speeches and other appearances on its behalf, in 2017. The story headline and text do make clear that only patients with cardiovascular disease and high levels of triglycerides or diabetes were in the trial, so it should be clear to readers that this drug was not shown to prevent disease in healthy people. The story does not give any details about potential harms of the drug. It reports key details of the trial, but without access to the full trial report, it is impossible to judge the quality of the evidence or its real significance. This story is based on the news release claim of a 25% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events. But what does that mean? It\u2019s difficult to say, because that outcome consists of a combination of cardiovascular disease death, heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization procedures (placing a stent in a blocked artery) and hospitalization for unstable angina (chest pain). Based on what little we know, it is possible that the 25% reduction was driven mainly by a lower rate of hospitalizations for chest pain \u2014 an outcome that\u2019s less important and also more subject to bias on the part of investigators who decide which patients get hospitalized and which ones don\u2019t. It\u2019s possible there was little or no reduction in deaths, heart attacks or strokes. Until the full trial results are released, we simply don\u2019t know.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9294,"claim":"Treating gum disease reduces prostate symptoms, CWRU researchers find","explanation":"This news release from Case Western Reserve University sets out to describe a relatively small study designed to further previous evidence for an observed link between\u00a0gum disease and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate). The study focuses on the likely common denominator of a body-wide biological process that releases inflammatory cytokines into blood and tissue, along with other possibilities; and on the clear possibility that non-surgical dental treatment will help. The study report in the journal Dentistry goes to some lengths to caution readers about the very shaky nature of this evidence and the fact that the study was not designed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between periodontitis (the fancy name for inflammatory gum disease) and high PSA levels in the blood of men with prostatitis symptoms. The study authors also lay out several caveats and limitations of their study, including the small number of participants and lack of a control group. Alas, the release fails to exercise that same wise caution. It misleadingly refers to PSA reductions that were not statistically significant, and states flatly that \u201cTreating gum disease reduced symptoms of prostate inflammation.\u201d This\u00a0overstates the value of the evidence presented in the study. Both periodontal disease and prostate disease (inflammation, tissue and tooth loss, and cancer) are widespread and have serious health consequences. Indeed, as the release and study point out, the suspected inflammatory process involved in both has also been linked to some forms of heart disease and autoimmune forms of arthritis. As a result, promoting dental care for gum disease as a means of reducing PSA levels and prostatitis (potential precursor signs of prostate cancer) poses a\u00a0tantalizing means of controlling real health problems. Promoting evidence that supports\u00a0the value of dental therapy in this context, however, should be accompanied by caution about the well-known debates over the meaning\u00a0of high or low\u00a0 PSA levels (especially in younger men and with only a single PSA test); and caution as well about the limitations of self-reported symptoms of prostatitis in a study with no control group. The authors of the study provide important context on these issues; we wish the news release had followed that lead.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":8966,"claim":"Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma","explanation":"This news release describes a phase 1b trial to test whether injecting an immune stimulant directly into metastatic melanoma lesions would change the environment around the tumor in ways that would make an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), more effective. But it\u2019s important the readers are left primarily with the understanding that the results are from the dose-escalation phase\u2013the part of a clinical trial where the researchers look to determine the \u201cbest\u201d dose, typically meaning the highest dose that can be used without causing adverse symptoms or side effects. The study was not designed to see whether this approach was better than the approach currently used, or if it helped some people with metastatic melanoma live longer. Yet, the headline states:\u00a0Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma. The sub-headline asserts, \u201cthe new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time.\u201d And the first paragraph asserts that \u201ca treatment that uses a bacteria-like agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma \u2026 live longer.\u201d None of that is known yet. It also is notable that the release made no mention of side effects among patients given this combination of therapies\u2013even though that\u2019s what this trial was examining. Immunotherapy has seen some of its greatest success in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. But it doesn\u2019t work in all patients. Scientists hope by learning why it doesn\u2019t always work they can develop new types of immunotherapies, new combinations of immunotherapies or new ways to use immunotherapy drugs that will achieve the desired response: allowing people with metastatic melanoma to live longer. This news release describes a study that included 22 people, nine of whom were receiving an immunotherapy for the first time. Seven of those nine had \u201ca positive response\u201d to the drug combination. In two, the tumors disappeared completely. That\u2019s a good thing. Would the patients have had the same response if they had received Keytruda alone? Maybe. Maybe not. There\u2019s no way to know. The study wasn\u2019t designed to test that.

PAP therapy is often given via CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines, and has been a standard treatment for sleep apnea for several decades. The release does a good job describing the study itself, and how the authors broke down patients into subgroups that compared age and socio-economic status. But the release also left much to be desired: it didn\u2019t describe the limitations of retrospective studies or adequately discuss the harms or costs of these machines, which can be prohibitively expensive for some patients. Most importantly, the news release did not do a good job of establishing the novelty of this study. While there was a large sample size and various measures of quality of life, it is still unclear how this study is new since the benefits of CPAP are already well known. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition in the United States (and the world). It affects about 20 million adult Americans each year, and significantly decreases quality of life due to poor sleep. Sufferers of sleep apnea report daytime symptoms as well, which can include drowsiness, moodiness, headaches, and lack of energy. However sleep apnea is also a well-studied condition, and it is already known that there are several interventions, including use of a CPAP machine, that can help improve symptoms and quality of life. It would be more newsworthy if the researchers had learned something different or new about CPAP treatment or sleep apnea, instead of re-establishing what has already been known for years. The most interesting thing from this news release was that those in lower socio-economic subgroups seemed to benefit less from PAP therapy\u2013perhaps this is a region worth further study.","label":"false"}

Note how the WebMD had an early quote, \u201cThis is great news.\u201d And the NY Times\u2019 first sentence said it \u201cmay be the next best thing\u201d to a cure.

Unfortunately, the common cold is also responsible for significant number of prescriptions for antibiotics despite the fact that antibiotics do not work against viral infections. The common cold can also trigger ear infections, sinusitis and worsen lung disease. The Cochrane review of published studies assessing the value of a number of different zinc products as both preventives and for treatment provides a new look at a long standing question; Do zinc salts provide any benefit in the treatment or prevention of the common cold?

Conversely, we wish this story had included more of the information necessary to give readers a complete picture of the benefits of this type of screening for cancer. Smoking rates and the incidence of lung cancer have been falling in the US for several years. Despite these gratifying trends, about 225,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 and approximately 157,000 will die from the disease. A major factor in survival after diagnosis is early detection. Chest X-rays are not sensitive enough to pick up lung cancer in its early stages. That is why more sophisticated diagnostic testing has been sought. Spiral computerized tomography (CT) has been touted as the best way to diagnose lung cancer early and save ives. This landmark study has demonstrated that spiral CT\u2019s are indeed more senstive than chest X-rays and that early detection can save lives. The study is by no means a complete answer, and it raises many questions. Who should be screened, when, how often and who is going to pay the enormous bill are some of the obvious questions.

The treatment involves implanting an electrical device which intermittently blocks the vagus nerve, which is involved with feelings of hunger and satiety. The segment does a few things well:   It introduces a patient who, one month into the therapy, has had promising but not spectacular results. It repeatedly mentions that the procedure is experimental, not yet available and unapproved for use in the U.S. It makes clear that VBLOC appears to be less effective than gastric bypass surgery, with possible weight loss of 20 percent at six months compared to 50 percent for bypass. But the segment could have been stronger:   It should have included at least one fully independent expert who could put the technique into perspective It should have provided more detail about the state and quality of the research upon which the promising results are based It should have emphasized the potential harms of the treatment, not the least of which is that it might not work for some people. For a treatment with a price tag of $15,000 to $20,000, that\u2019s a significant risk.

It could have used more space to clear up the confusion it causes in reviewing the evidence. The results of the most recent research on the topic, though conducted as a randomized clincial trial, were disregarded in favor of the more appealing result \u2013 i.e. that a common, readily available product can be used to reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It would have been far more useful to explain about why there may be discrepancies between research studies, how a reader might go about assessing the information, and, when there are differences in outcomes,\u00a0 how one can make a decision about the options. The story stated that \u201cpeople who took a low dose of aspirin every day for several years reduced their risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s by 13 percent.\u201d\u00a0 However the study itself reported that use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significant reduction in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Thus the story did not accurately report on these results and compounded this with its concluding statement. The story only listed stomach bleeding and ulcers as side effects of aspirin. The story also failed to include information about often it occurs. However as this is a story about prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it should have mentioned that the bleeding risks associated with aspirin use increase with age.

When results are only available in a press release, it\u2019s even more critical to get assessment from clearly independent sources.

{"claim_id":9336,"claim":"Fish Oil Pills During Pregnancy Might Mean Stronger, Healthier Kids","explanation":"This HealthDay story describes a study published in the British Medical Journal that looked at whether pregnant women who took fish oil supplements in their third trimester\u00a0produced healthier children based on their growth statistics and body mass index, compared to mothers who did not. The study was a high-quality randomized controlled trial of the effects of fish oil during pregnancy on asthma in children, which looked at effects on body mass index as a secondary outcome measure. The story included multiple independent sources to provide perspective, and it included a few key details about the study. While it provided the scope of the benefit of taking fish oil, it could have gone a step further to explain if those measured benefits really mean much for children\u2019s health. There is great interest in understanding the effects of interventions during pregnancy on the health of the offspring, but such studies are difficult to conduct, since assessing outcomes that occur years following the pregnancy can be a challenge. Although the effects of fish oil supplements on children\u2019s growth was not the primary intention of this trial, the results do suggest\u00a0that mothers who take the supplements during their last trimester have children whose body mass index and body measurements for up to six years of age are better than the children of mothers who didn\u2019t take the supplements.

{"claim_id":10198,"claim":"Stanford team finds blood test to help identify Alzheimer\u2019s disease","explanation":"This was a story about a method described in a recently published letter to the journal Nature Medicine for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While providing some details of the results outlined in the letter, the story failed to provide context to help readers understand the risks and benefits that might be associated with the kind of test described. The story failed to mention that if the test were to be demonstrated to have utility for early identification of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, its initial greatest benefit would probably come from identifying individuals who might then participate in clinical trials to develop treatments for improved management of the condition. The story did a good job in:   providing actual numbers (e.g., test was positive for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 38 out of 42 patients\u2026.) and % accuracy rate  using a lot of cautionary phrases (e.g., \"preliminary studies\") and has specific caution that will be at least 2 years before available (after further testing) and \"\u2026all technologies a long way from being available in clinics\". However, the story doesn\u2019t give much discussion about the specific limitations of this study. For example, this case-control type of patient selection almost always overestimates test accuracy. So it\u2019s likely to perform worse in real world populations. The story also didn\u2019t comment on the fact that the publication in the journal Nature Medicine was actually a letter \u2013 which is curious and almost demands comment. Although methods are published, why was it not published as an original article about original research? As a letter, was it peer-reviewed? The same as original articles?

{"claim_id":10352,"claim":"New Breast Reconstruction Technique Provides Better Outcomes, Less Discomfort for Women Recovering From Breast Cancer","explanation":"It\u2019s hard to ignore a news release that claims a reconstructive breast surgery technique is \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201chas the potential to be a \u2018game-changer,'\u201d as does this one from The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey. The release focuses on the outcome of one 43-year-old\u00a0woman who received the hospital system\u2019s first attempt at the surgery and\u00a0is\u00a0quoted extensively in the release. The\u00a0procedure in question is available to some women who get a mastectomy following diagnosis, yet want an implant to recreate the appearance of their breast or breasts. After the breast tissue is removed, a balloon-like sac is temporarily placed in the void left behind and gradually filled with fluid. This prepares the skin and muscles nearby for a permanent implant, which is typically inserted a couple of months later for \u201can excellent aesthetic outcome.\u201d This all sounds wonderful, but our review team (which includes a breast surgeon) thought the release was nearly devoid of crucial context. It doesn\u2019t adequately discuss costs, risks, evidence, or alternatives, and it doesn\u2019t make clear how this procedure differs from similar, more common implant techniques. It also trumpets the outcome of one woman, whose experience with the procedure \u2014 while extremely positive \u2014 may not hold true for many women who elect to have mastectomies. At best, this release is an incomplete advertisement. Electing to have breast surgery is often an extraordinarily difficult decision: Every patient\u2019s cancer, her risks, and her needs are different. And while it\u2019s nice to have options for reconstructive breast surgery \u2014 a topic that\u2019s important to women affected by breast cancer \u2014 the advantages or disadvantages of one procedure over another seems to become less clear as more techniques become available. That\u2019s why it\u2019s increasingly important for medical institutions that promote the latest-and-greatest cosmetic procedure make clear its place\u00a0in a cornucopia of alternatives, and adequately discuss the risks of surgeries\u00a0that may have little or no bearing on survival or other critical outcomes.","label":"false"}

Some of the flaws commented on were not present in the original AP story. The story was about a\u00a010-year retrospective study of adverse events resulting from adolescent use of insulin pumps conducted by the FDA and published in the May issue of the journal Pediatrics. Insulin pumps are being used more often to deliver insulin to the body through a plastic tube with a\u00a0small tip that inserts under the skin. The article provides a good description of the\u00a0pumps, indicating that they are approximately the size of a cell phone and can be worn on a belt or kept in a pocket. Insulin pumps have been primarily used by adults but are now being used more often by adolescents because it allows them to lead more normal lives by eliminating the need for them to give themselves insulin injections in public. The results of adverse events reported by in the FDA\u00a0study, including 13 deaths and more than 1,500 pump-related\u00a0injuries over the past decade, were accurately presented. However, no denominator was given so the numbers lose context and meaning. Estimated causes of these adverse events \u2013 patient misuse, lack of education,\u00a0and device malfunction \u2013 were also described. A notable omission from the story was\u00a0the importance of parental supervision as three\u00a0of the 13 deaths occurred when there was no adult supervision. The original AP story provided a good overall summary of the health concerns related to insulin pump use among adolescents and the need for for more study to address safety concerns. But all for the sake of cutting 290 words, the St. Paul Pioneer Press version lost:\u00a0   any discussion of cost \u2013 something lacking in about 75% of all stories we review.

{"claim_id":11003,"claim":"Wrist replacement surgery is a last resort for those who wish to save hand\u2019s range of motion","explanation":"Patients who suffer with hand and wrist arthritis face a number of treatment options, none of them especially good ones. This article attempts to show how one surgical procedure\u2014the replacement of the wrist joint\u2014fits into the spectrum of treatment choices. It notes that the \u201cseldom-used\u201d operation has been around for decades, and accurately reflects the complexity of the operation. Although the story mentions some of the alternatives to joint replacement (e.g. medications, physical therapy, and fusion)\u2014and briefly sketches their advantages and disadvantages, it does not attempt to evaluate the quality of the evidence to support any of them. The story provides no data on whether the operation is appropriate in some people and not others, no measure or list of potential complications or costs, and\u00a0no quantification of the procedure's absolute benefit or its relative worth compared to other treatments. The heart of the story is essentially a collection of anecdotes from one patient and one surgeon in one city in Texas. The article provides no news and little analysis, and largely reflects the story line of a recently issued press release from the institution where the surgeon performs these operations.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":10772,"claim":"New psoriasis drug is more effective than current treatment","explanation":"The news release announces the results of a phase II clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which found that an experimental drug called guselkumab was more effective than a drug already on the market (called adalimumab) at controlling the symptoms of psoriasis. However, the release leaves some significant gaps, not giving readers any information about potential harms or costs associated with guselkumab. The release falls victim to the common practice of hyperbole in its headline. This was a phase II trial in a relatively small number of subjects. Suggesting that guselkumab is both more effective and less toxic than adalimumab is nothing more than speculation at this juncture. A more appropriate title would have been, \u201cEarly phase II trial suggests that new psoriasis drug may be more effective\u00a0and has the potential to leave\u00a0more of normal immune system intact.\u201d \u00a0According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, more than 5 million people in the U.S. have psoriasis. The disease can have a significant impact on quality of life, and treatment can be extraordinarily expensive, so information about new, effective treatment options is certainly worth noting. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. While psoriasis itself is not life-threatening, because it is an autoimmune disease, some pharmaceutical treatment options affect the immune system and can increase a patient\u2019s risk of infections \u2014 and those infections may pose a significant health risk of their own. This makes it particularly important for readers to be aware of potential health risks associated with new treatment options.","label":"false"}

What's false: There's no evidence to prove that he made any art choices regarding colors, lines, or other specifics of the logo's design. Rather, he provided inspiration for it by showing NFL executives photos of Native American leaders that he believed should be part of the Washington team's brand.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10461,"claim":"Researchers produce first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia","explanation":"In many ways, this release provides much of the basic information reporters would need to determine how newsworthy the findings are. Where it was published. The specific antigen being studied and for which disease. A numerical breakdown of the benefits. But nowhere does it mention that this was a study conducted in mice and that, if past experiences with vaccines for other diseases hold true, a true vaccine for humans has a narrow chance of becoming a reality. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says the condition is easily treated, but if left untreated, can make it difficult for a woman to become pregnant A further complication of chlamydia is that it often carries no symptoms, so someone who is infected may not even know it. A safe and effective vaccine would certainly be of public health interest. But this research has to far to go before it will be available to the public \u2014 if ever.","label":"false"}
